This deployment scenario will assume you are deploying onto IBM Cloud however the steps would generally apply to an OpenShift cluster deployed on another cloud provider, or on-premise. The exception to this would be the setup of the persistent storage needed by the Event Manager. On IBM Cloud, it is recommended to simply use `ibmc-block-gold` for your storage class. If it is another cloud provider, select their alternative block storage option. For on-premise deployments, a good option would be VMware vSphere storage, particularly if you are already a VMware shop. In any case, block storage is recommended for performance reasons.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed notes on the topic of storage, see the documentation link: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-storage\r\n\r\nBy the end of this module, you will have provisioned an OpenShift cluster, prepared your cluster, installed the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator, and deployed an instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager. You will then appreciate just how convenient and easy it is to deploy and maintain the next generation of operations management solutions from IBM.\r\n\r\n## 2-2: Create your OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud \r\n\r\n**NOTE: If cluster has already been provisioned, you can skip to section 2-3.**\r\n\r\nThe Event Manager documentation specifies two sizes of deployment: trial and production.\r\n\r\nFor a trial sized deployment, the recommended specification is as follows:\r\n\r\n* 3 worker nodes\r\n* each with 8 CPUs\r\n* each with 24GB RAM\r\n* each with 120GB disk\r\n\r\nFor a production deployment, the recommended specification is as follows:\r\n\r\n* 6 worker nodes\r\n* each with 14 CPUs\r\n* each with 35GB RAM\r\n* each with 120GB disk\r\n\r\nNOTE: If your platform does not offer these exact specifications, then choose worker node specifications that exceed these minimums.\r\n\r\nDocumentation reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-sizing\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, these instructions use the IBM Cloud platform to create an OpenShift cluster. Log into https://cloud.ibm.com and select Openshift → Clusters from the hamburger menu in the top-left hand corner.\r\n\r\nNext click on Create cluster and use the following to create and deploy your cluster:\r\n\r\n* Choose **Manual** setup with a **Classic** infrastructure.\r\n* Leave the **Resource group** as **Default**.\r\n* Choose the **Geography** closest to you, and choose **Single zone** for **Availability**.\r\n* Choose the **Worker zone** in a city that is closest to you.\r\n* Under **Worker pool**, click **Change flavor** and select a worker node configuration that matches or exceeds that listed above.\r\n* Leave the **Worker pool name** as **default, Encrypt local disk** if you like, and you can leave **Master service endpoint** as **Public endpoint only**.\r\n* Choose **OpenShift 4.8.x** for your **Orchestration service** type and version.\r\n* Select your **OCP entitlement** from the drop-down, and modify your **Cluster name** if you like.\r\n* Click **Create** to create your OpenShift cluster. Provisioning should take around 20 minutes or so.\r\n\r\n![](images/0_OCPCluster.png)\r\n\r\n## 2-3: Obtain your Entitlement key \r\n\r\nNavigate to [**ibm.com**](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) to obtain your **entitlement key** that is assigned to your IBM ID which will grant you access to the IBM Entitled Registry. Copy this into a text editor in preparation for the next step. This will be needed for deploying an instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\nYou can check your entitlement for Watson AIOPs by clicking **View Library**\r\n\r\n![](images/entitlement_check.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If your entitlement key is not valid for Watson for AIOps Event Manager, you can register for a 60 day trial using the following link: [Request Watson AIOps trial](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/login?formid=urx-51074).\r\n\r\n## 2-4: Prepare your OpenShift cluster\r\n\r\nThis step involves creating a namespace (also known as a \"Project\" on OpenShift) to install the Watson for AIOps Event Manager Operator into, and setting up your software entitlement key, so that you will be able to deploy an instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\nThis section involves the following tasks:\r\n\r\n- Navigate to and open the **OpenShift UI**\r\n- Connect to a \"control\" virtual machine that you can administer the cluster from, or install `oc` locallaly and use your own laptop\r\n- Acquire an OpenShift login token and log in to the OpenShift cluster via the command line\r\n- Create a **namespace** to deploy Event Manager into\r\n- Create an **entitlement key secret**\r\n\r\nDuring this module, you will need to log in a \"control\" virtual machine on which the `oc` utility is already installed, so that you can run certain commands to prepare the cluster. Alternatively you can download the `oc` command via the OpenShift UI and run the commands locally on your laptop.\r\n\r\nOpen a web browser and log in to: [https://cloud.ibm.com](https://cloud.ibm.com). In the top-right corner of the screen, ensure that the right account is selected from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the menu button in the top-left corner, select **OpenShift**, then **Clusters**.\r\n\r\nClick on your \"manage-from\" OpenShift cluster, then click the blue **OpenShift web console** button to open the main OpenShift UI:\r\n\r\n![](images/1_OpenshiftWebConsole.png)\r\n\r\nIf you want to install the `oc` client locally on your laptop, look on the OpenShift UI for a button on the top-right corner of your screen with a question mark on it (**?**). Click on it and select **Command line tools**. From here, you can download and install the `oc` utility that corresponds to your operating system. Windows users should use **Windows Powershell** for any terminal sessions.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to obtain the login command to connect to and authenticate with the OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\nIn the top-right corner of the OpenShift UI, click on your username, then select **Copy Login Command**. You should get a new tab open with a link to **Display Token**. Click on this link to reveal the cluster login command that you will need to authenticate to the OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\n![](images/2_LoginCommand.png)\r\n\r\nCopy the full **oc login** command displayed under **Log in with this token** and save it into Notepad or a local text editor.\r\n\r\nGo to your terminal session (either local or on a remote host) and paste the full \"oc login\" command, and press Enter. This command will make a connection to your cluster and authenticate you, so you will be ready to start preparing the cluster by issuing various commands against it.\r\n\r\nFrom your terminal session, issue the following command to create the namespace:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc create namespace noi\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This example uses **noi** as the name of the namespace. You can call it whatever you like however. The rest of the tutorial commands are based on `namespace=noi` so it's advisable to use it to avoid any errors.\r\n\r\nAfter you have created the namespace, switch to it using the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc project noi\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is important to know which project/namespace you are in when issuing `oc` commands. All of the subsequent commands need to be run in the `noi` project/namespace otherwise the various elements you create may not be available to use in later steps.\r\n\r\nPrepare a command like the following, that uses your entitlement key to create a registry secret.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc create secret docker-registry noi-registry-secret --docker-username=cp --docker-password=aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJ0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0 --docker-server=cp.icr.io --namespace=noi\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n\r\n* You can call the secret anything you like however the suggested value is: **noi-registry-secret**\r\n* The docker-username is always: **cp**\r\n* The docker-password is your **entitlement key**, copied from ibm.com\r\n* The docker-server should be: **cp.icr.io**\r\n* The namespace is the one you created in the previous step - ie. **noi**\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to install the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator, and then deploy an instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this topic, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-your-cluster](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-your-cluster)\r\n\r\n## 2-5: Install the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator\r\n\r\nNew OpenShift clusters are pre-configured with Red Hat software repositories only. The next step of deploying Event Manager is to add a new software repository to your new OpenShift cluster so that it knows where to go to get the Event Manager software. Once the IBM software repository source has been added to your system, you will be able to add the Event Manager Operator, which will then pull down the Event Manager software images to the cluster, so that you can deploy an instance of the Event Manager.\r\n\r\nIn your browser window, return to the OpenShift UI. In the top-right corner, near your user ID, click on the plus icon (**+**). This will take you to a \"Import YAML\" page.\r\n\r\nPaste the following code block into the black box, and click **Create**:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1\r\nkind: CatalogSource\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: ibm-operator-catalog\r\n  namespace: openshift-marketplace\r\nspec:\r\n  displayName: ibm-operator-catalog\r\n  publisher: IBM Content\r\n  sourceType: grpc\r\n  image: icr.io/cpopen/ibm-operator-catalog:latest\r\n  updateStrategy:\r\n    registryPoll:\r\n      interval: 45m\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is essential to ensure the indentation is correctly copied over.\r\n\r\nOn the main left menu, navigate to **Administration > Cluster Settings**. Under **Configuration > OperatorHub > Sources**, verify that the `ibm-operator-catalog` CatalogSource object is present.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It can take a few minutes to pull down the entire catalogue list, but you should end up with around 221 in the **# of Operators** column and show a READY status.\r\n\r\nNext, navigate to: **Operators > Operator Hub** and search for **Event Manager**.\r\n\r\nClick on **IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager** and then **Install**.\r\n\r\nUse the following options:\r\n\r\n* **Update channel**: choose the latest: **v1.9**\r\n* **Installation mode**: select **A specific namespace on the cluster** and select your previously created namespace - ie. **noi**\r\n* Leave **Update approval** set to **Automatic**\r\n* Click **Install**\r\n\r\nInstallation of the Operator should take a few minutes, as it pulls down the installation packages from the IBM software repository.\r\n\r\nNavigate to: **Operators > Installed Operators** and you will be able to monitor the progress of the Operator installation.  When it has finished, it will look like this:\r\n\r\n![](images/6_InstalledOperator.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Ensure your namespace, also referred to as **Project**, is selected from the top drop-down menu - ie. **noi**\r\n\r\nThe Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator is now installed and ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this topic, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=installing-olm-ui](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=installing-olm-ui)\r\n\r\n## 2-6: Deploy an instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager\r\n\r\nThis final step of deployment involves deploying a running instance of Event Manager onto the OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\nBefore deploying an instance of Event Manager, you will need to know your cluster's **Ingress subdomain**. To obtain this, return to your IBM Cloud browser tab where you have the \"manage-from\" cluster details open, and scroll down to the **Networking** section. You will see a box labelled **Ingress subdomain** that contains the domain value for your cluster:\r\n\r\n![](images/7_Ingress.png)\r\n\r\nCopy and paste this value into a text editor for use during the instance deployment.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** During the Event Manager deployment, you will be asked for your OpenShift **Cluster Domain (FQDN)** as part of the configuration. You should use this value you just copied from the **Ingress subdomain** box for this entry. Do not prepend the value with `apps.` for instance, or modify it in any way; just use it as-is.\r\n\r\nNavigate to: **Operators > Installed Operators** and click on **IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager**.\r\n\r\nClick on the **NOI** tab and click the button **Create NOI**.  You will be prompted to enter the configuration settings for your new instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** NOI stands for **Netcool Operations Insight** and is the same thing as **Watson for AIOps Event Manager** in this context.\r\n\r\nUse the following to guide you through the various configuration settings. Where there is no note about any parameter given, you can leave it as its default setting:\r\n\r\n* Use the default value of `evtmanager` for the **Name**\r\n* Choose **noi-registry-secret** for your **Entitlement Secret** (this is the one you created in step 2-4)\r\n* Click on **License** and set License accept to **true**\r\n* Ensure **Version** is set to the latest value\r\n* Under **Cluster Domain (FQDN)**, enter the **Ingress subdomain** value you copied earlier\r\n* Under **Deployment Type**, choose **trial**\r\n* Click on **LDAP** and select **ibmc-block-gold** for the Storage Class\r\n* Click on **Persistence** and set Persistence Enabled to **true** and select **ibmc-block-gold** for each **StorageClass** prompt\r\n* Click on **Topology** and and select **ibmc-block-gold** for both StorageClass prompts\r\n* Review the list of Topology Observers available - we just need the File Observer for these labs so you can leave the defaults\r\n* Click on **Create** to begin deploying your Event Manager instance\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is essential that you take your time entering all these values and checking they are correct before clicking OK. If you make an error, you will likely have to remove the instance and its associated persistent volume claims and start again. Therefore it is worth taking the time to review the whole list of settings before you create your instance.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of your instance will normally take about 20 to 30 minutes. You can monitor the deployment's progress both from Installed Operators page as well as from: **Workloads > Pods** page. Ensure that the Project drop-down menu at the top of the page is set to your namespace (\"noi\"). Once all the pods have deployed and are showing with a Status of Running and 1/1 or 2/2, you will know that your deployment has completed. You can sort your pods by \"Ready\" status, and filter on all pods except for \"Completed\" jobs to monitor the deployment progess.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Don't worry if you see some pods report an error state during the course of the deployment. This is simply because many pods are dependent on others, and so complain if they come up before those others. The system will simply retry to deploy these pods over and over, and so eventually everything will deploy and come up in the end.\r\n\r\nThis can also be confirmed by returning to the Installed Operators page and seeing: **Phase: OK** next to your deployment:\r\n\r\n![](images/8_NOI.png)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully deployed an OpenShift cluster, installed the Watson for AIOps Event Manager Operator, and deployed an instance of the Event Manager.\r\n\r\n## 2-7: Locate your login details and log in to Watson for AIOps Event Manager\r\n\r\nNext you are going to locate your login credentials from your newly deployed instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager and log in to the console.\r\n\r\nReturn to the OpenShift UI in your web browser and navigate to: **Workloads > Secrets**\r\n\r\nIn the search bar, type **icpadmin** and click on the secret labelled: **evtmanager-icpadmin-secret**\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The name of the secret is based on the name of your NOI deployment. If you have kept the default of **evtmanager**, it will be labelled per the above.\r\n\r\nClick on the secret, and scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Data** section, and you will see a data item called: **ICP_ADMIN_PASSWORD**. On the right-hand side of the page, click on **Reveal values**. This will cause the password to be made visible. Copy this and save it in a local text file on your laptop for later use. This is the password to your Watson for AIOps Event Manager. Note that the username is: **icpadmin**\r\n\r\nThe access URL for your Event Manager instance is in the format:\r\n\r\n`https://netcool-<deployment-name>.<ingress-subdomain>`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`https://netcool-evtmanager.tech-jam-dal12-08-manage-d8e5ccad3849ed39158bb0b911cc2b44-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud`\r\n\r\nGo to your Event Manager login page and log in as **icpadmin**, using the password you just obtained from the secret above.\r\n\r\nBy default, the **icpadmin** user does not have the full list of roles assigned to it to operate Event Manager capabilities. It is necessary to assign all administrative roles to the icpadmin user before continuing to the next module.\r\n\r\nUse the following steps to set this up:\r\n\r\n* Return to the Event Manager UI main screen in your web browser\r\n* Click on the menu button in the top-left corner of the screen, and select **Netcool WebGUI** from the drop-down menu\r\n* A new tab will open with the Netcool/WebGUI UI displayed\r\n* Click on the cog wheel in the top-right hand corner of the screen, and select **User Roles** from the drop-down menu\r\n* Click on the **Search** button to bring up all users (this instigates an unfiltered user search)\r\n* From the list of returned users, click on **icpadmin**\r\n* Check all available **Roles** in the list, then scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Save**\r\n* Close the Netcool/WebGUI browser tab, then log out of the Event Manager UI, and log back in again (as **icpadmin**)\r\n* Click on the left menu again and you will now see the full list of menu items\r\n\r\nYou have now completed this module and are ready for module \"Connect an on-premise Probe to Watson for AIOps Event Manager\"\r\n\r\n[Reference Blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/04/01/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-17)\r\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a63d9a4e08918eebfc72289ed0f68198","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1601},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deployment","description":"Deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager onto OpenShift"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: Deployment\r\ndescription: Deploy IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager onto OpenShift\r\n---\r\n\r\n<AnchorLinks>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-1: Overview</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-2: Create your OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-3: Obtain your Entitlement key </AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-4: Prepare your OpenShift cluster</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-5: Install the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-6: Deploy an instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>2-7: Locate your login details and log in to Watson for AIOps Event Manager</AnchorLink>\r\n</AnchorLinks>\r\n\r\n## 2-1: Overview\r\n\r\nThis module focuses on the initial deployment of the Watson for AIOps Event Manager.

All of the subsequent commands need to be run in the `noi` project/namespace otherwise the various elements you create may not be available to use in later steps.\r\n\r\nPrepare a command like the following, that uses your entitlement key to create a registry secret.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc create secret docker-registry noi-registry-secret --docker-username=cp --docker-password=aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJ0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0 --docker-server=cp.icr.io --namespace=noi\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n\r\n* You can call the secret anything you like however the suggested value is: **noi-registry-secret**\r\n* The docker-username is always: **cp**\r\n* The docker-password is your **entitlement key**, copied from ibm.com\r\n* The docker-server should be: **cp.icr.io**\r\n* The namespace is the one you created in the previous step - ie. **noi**\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to install the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator, and then deploy an instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this topic, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-your-cluster](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=preparing-your-cluster)\r\n\r\n## 2-5: Install the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator\r\n\r\nNew OpenShift clusters are pre-configured with Red Hat software repositories only. The next step of deploying Event Manager is to add a new software repository to your new OpenShift cluster so that it knows where to go to get the Event Manager software. Once the IBM software repository source has been added to your system, you will be able to add the Event Manager Operator, which will then pull down the Event Manager software images to the cluster, so that you can deploy an instance of the Event Manager.\r\n\r\nIn your browser window, return to the OpenShift UI. In the top-right corner, near your user ID, click on the plus icon (**+**). This will take you to a \"Import YAML\" page.\r\n\r\nPaste the following code block into the black box, and click **Create**:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1\r\nkind: CatalogSource\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: ibm-operator-catalog\r\n  namespace: openshift-marketplace\r\nspec:\r\n  displayName: ibm-operator-catalog\r\n  publisher: IBM Content\r\n  sourceType: grpc\r\n  image: icr.io/cpopen/ibm-operator-catalog:latest\r\n  updateStrategy:\r\n    registryPoll:\r\n      interval: 45m\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is essential to ensure the indentation is correctly copied over.\r\n\r\nOn the main left menu, navigate to **Administration > Cluster Settings**. Under **Configuration > OperatorHub > Sources**, verify that the `ibm-operator-catalog` CatalogSource object is present.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It can take a few minutes to pull down the entire catalogue list, but you should end up with around 221 in the **# of Operators** column and show a READY status.\r\n\r\nNext, navigate to: **Operators > Operator Hub** and search for **Event Manager**.\r\n\r\nClick on **IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager** and then **Install**.\r\n\r\nUse the following options:\r\n\r\n* **Update channel**: choose the latest: **v1.9**\r\n* **Installation mode**: select **A specific namespace on the cluster** and select your previously created namespace - ie. **noi**\r\n* Leave **Update approval** set to **Automatic**\r\n* Click **Install**\r\n\r\nInstallation of the Operator should take a few minutes, as it pulls down the installation packages from the IBM software repository.\r\n\r\nNavigate to: **Operators > Installed Operators** and you will be able to monitor the progress of the Operator installation.  When it has finished, it will look like this:\r\n\r\n![](images/6_InstalledOperator.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Ensure your namespace, also referred to as **Project**, is selected from the top drop-down menu - ie. **noi**\r\n\r\nThe Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager Operator is now installed and ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this topic, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=installing-olm-ui](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=installing-olm-ui)\r\n\r\n## 2-6: Deploy an instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager\r\n\r\nThis final step of deployment involves deploying a running instance of Event Manager onto the OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\nBefore deploying an instance of Event Manager, you will need to know your cluster's **Ingress subdomain**. To obtain this, return to your IBM Cloud browser tab where you have the \"manage-from\" cluster details open, and scroll down to the **Networking** section. You will see a box labelled **Ingress subdomain** that contains the domain value for your cluster:\r\n\r\n![](images/7_Ingress.png)\r\n\r\nCopy and paste this value into a text editor for use during the instance deployment.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** During the Event Manager deployment, you will be asked for your OpenShift **Cluster Domain (FQDN)** as part of the configuration. You should use this value you just copied from the **Ingress subdomain** box for this entry. Do not prepend the value with `apps.` for instance, or modify it in any way; just use it as-is.\r\n\r\nNavigate to: **Operators > Installed Operators** and click on **IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager**.\r\n\r\nClick on the **NOI** tab and click the button **Create NOI**.  You will be prompted to enter the configuration settings for your new instance of Event Manager.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** NOI stands for **Netcool Operations Insight** and is the same thing as **Watson for AIOps Event Manager** in this context.\r\n\r\nUse the following to guide you through the various configuration settings. Where there is no note about any parameter given, you can leave it as its default setting:\r\n\r\n* Use the default value of `evtmanager` for the **Name**\r\n* Choose **noi-registry-secret** for your **Entitlement Secret** (this is the one you created in step 2-4)\r\n* Click on **License** and set License accept to **true**\r\n* Ensure **Version** is set to the latest value\r\n* Under **Cluster Domain (FQDN)**, enter the **Ingress subdomain** value you copied earlier\r\n* Under **Deployment Type**, choose **trial**\r\n* Click on **LDAP** and select **ibmc-block-gold** for the Storage Class\r\n* Click on **Persistence** and set Persistence Enabled to **true** and select **ibmc-block-gold** for each **StorageClass** prompt\r\n* Click on **Topology** and and select **ibmc-block-gold** for both StorageClass prompts\r\n* Review the list of Topology Observers available - we just need the File Observer for these labs so you can leave the defaults\r\n* Click on **Create** to begin deploying your Event Manager instance\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is essential that you take your time entering all these values and checking they are correct before clicking OK. If you make an error, you will likely have to remove the instance and its associated persistent volume claims and start again. Therefore it is worth taking the time to review the whole list of settings before you create your instance.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of your instance will normally take about 20 to 30 minutes. You can monitor the deployment's progress both from Installed Operators page as well as from: **Workloads > Pods** page. Ensure that the Project drop-down menu at the top of the page is set to your namespace (\"noi\"). Once all the pods have deployed and are showing with a Status of Running and 1/1 or 2/2, you will know that your deployment has completed. You can sort your pods by \"Ready\" status, and filter on all pods except for \"Completed\" jobs to monitor the deployment progess.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Don't worry if you see some pods report an error state during the course of the deployment. This is simply because many pods are dependent on others, and so complain if they come up before those others. The system will simply retry to deploy these pods over and over, and so eventually everything will deploy and come up in the end.\r\n\r\nThis can also be confirmed by returning to the Installed Operators page and seeing: **Phase: OK** next to your deployment:\r\n\r\n![](images/8_NOI.png)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully deployed an OpenShift cluster, installed the Watson for AIOps Event Manager Operator, and deployed an instance of the Event Manager.\r\n\r\n## 2-7: Locate your login details and log in to Watson for AIOps Event Manager\r\n\r\nNext you are going to locate your login credentials from your newly deployed instance of Watson for AIOps Event Manager and log in to the console.\r\n\r\nReturn to the OpenShift UI in your web browser and navigate to: **Workloads > Secrets**\r\n\r\nIn the search bar, type **icpadmin** and click on the secret labelled: **evtmanager-icpadmin-secret**\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The name of the secret is based on the name of your NOI deployment. If you have kept the default of **evtmanager**, it will be labelled per the above.\r\n\r\nClick on the secret, and scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Data** section, and you will see a data item called: **ICP_ADMIN_PASSWORD**. On the right-hand side of the page, click on **Reveal values**. This will cause the password to be made visible. Copy this and save it in a local text file on your laptop for later use. This is the password to your Watson for AIOps Event Manager. Note that the username is: **icpadmin**\r\n\r\nThe access URL for your Event Manager instance is in the format:\r\n\r\n`https://netcool-<deployment-name>.<ingress-subdomain>`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`https://netcool-evtmanager.tech-jam-dal12-08-manage-d8e5ccad3849ed39158bb0b911cc2b44-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud`\r\n\r\nGo to your Event Manager login page and log in as **icpadmin**, using the password you just obtained from the secret above.\r\n\r\nBy default, the **icpadmin** user does not have the full list of roles assigned to it to operate Event Manager capabilities. It is necessary to assign all administrative roles to the icpadmin user before continuing to the next module.\r\n\r\nUse the following steps to set this up:\r\n\r\n* Return to the Event Manager UI main screen in your web browser\r\n* Click on the menu button in the top-left corner of the screen, and select **Netcool WebGUI** from the drop-down menu\r\n* A new tab will open with the Netcool/WebGUI UI displayed\r\n* Click on the cog wheel in the top-right hand corner of the screen, and select **User Roles** from the drop-down menu\r\n* Click on the **Search** button to bring up all users (this instigates an unfiltered user search)\r\n* From the list of returned users, click on **icpadmin**\r\n* Check all available **Roles** in the list, then scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Save**\r\n* Close the Netcool/WebGUI browser tab, then log out of the Event Manager UI, and log back in again (as **icpadmin**)\r\n* Click on the left menu again and you will now see the full list of menu items\r\n\r\nYou have now completed this module and are ready for module \"Connect an on-premise Probe to Watson for AIOps Event Manager\"\r\n\r\n[Reference Blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/04/01/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-17)\r\n","fileAbsolutePath":"C:/Users/103537778/git/waiops-tech-jam/src/pages/tutorials/aiops/installation/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
