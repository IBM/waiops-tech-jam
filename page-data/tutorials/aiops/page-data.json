Provide guidence on configuring Slack ChatOps, Log Connectors, Instana Connector, Topology Observers, and ServiceNow connector.\n\n**[Resource Management](/tutorials/aiops/resources/resource-management)**: Discusses the concepts of topological resources and how they map to incoming data (metrics, alerts and logs).  Instana connector defined resources are explained.  Topology rules are also discussed.\n\n**[Policies](/tutorials/aiops/policies/introduction)**: Covers policies for associating runbooks to alerts and when to create stories.\n\n**[Runbook Automation](/tutorials/aiops/automations/ssh)**: Discusses runbooks and automations (SSH, HTTP and Ansible Tower) for both AI Manager and Event Manager.\n\n**[Event Manager Configuration](/tutorials/aiops/eventmanager-configuration/onprem-probe)**: Discusses Evetn Manager configuration options (probes, web hooks, and topologies).\n\n**[Hints Tips](/tutorials/aiops/hintstips/aiops-architecture)**: Provide architecture guidance on how to set up AIOps. Other topics include using EFK stack, offline training, pre-trained models, and tips for debugging the cloud pak.
