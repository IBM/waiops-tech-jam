We will focus on the properties that are typically most useful to enable of modify. This module also covers a few other final configuration points to consider when setting up a new environment, including installing housekeeping automations, setting up a few additional Filters and Views, and a couple of optional ObjectServer trigger modifications.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this module, you will have reviewed and possibly modified some of the grouping automation options, reviewed and installed housekeeping automations, created Filters and Views, and optionally made a couple of ObjectServer trigger modifications.\r\n\r\n## 8-2: Review and modify grouping automation properties\r\n\r\nThe ObjectServer is the name for the event database embedded within Watson for AIOps Event Manager that receives and stores events. It also provides trigger-based automation to enable additional capabilities, as well as to facilitate the implementation of custom automation. Part of the event grouping capabilities provided by Event Manager are implemented as triggers. There is a table in the ObjectServer called **master.cea_properties** that contains a number of user-modifiable properties that tweak the behaviours of the event grouping automation. This section highlights key ones that you may likely want to modify.\r\n\r\nThe **master.cea_properties** table has three main fields: **Name**, **IntValue**, and **CharValue**. Some of the properties refer to textual labels whereas most of them are either a boolean value (ie. 0 or 1) or are a numeric value. In the former case, the property will make use of the `CharValue` field, and in the latter case, the property will make use of the `IntValue` field.\r\n\r\nThe following properties should be reviewed and considered for modification, if desired.\r\n\r\n**CEACKeyPrefix**\r\n\r\nThis property specifies the prefix to be prepended to the Summary field of synthetic parent events. This property is of type CharValue and has a default value of \"GROUP\", which causes synthetic parent events to look like this in the Alerts view:\r\n\r\nDefault look like this:\r\n![](images/Summary1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter Modifying this setting:\r\n![](images/Summary2.png)\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEACKeyPrefix**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set CharValue = 'INCIDENT' where Name = 'CEACKeyPrefix';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent**\r\n\r\nBy default, all synthetic parent events will use a unique group identifier in its Node field. By enabling this property, the system will use the Node value of the first received event into the group instead, for the Node field of the synthetic parent.\r\n\r\nThe default looks like this:\r\n![](images/Node1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter enabling this setting:\r\n![](images/Node2.png)\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAUseCKeyCustomText**\r\n\r\nBy default, the Summary field of the synthetic parent event follows the format:\r\n\r\n`<CEACKeyPrefix>: (N active events) <Summary-of-probable-cause-event>`\r\n\r\nIt is possible to append custom text to the end of this Summary string by first populating the `CustomText field` of the synthetic parent event and then enabling this property. By default it is disabled.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAUseCKeyCustomText**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAUseCKeyCustomText';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\nNOTE: If the `CustomText` field value is blank, then enabling this field will visibly have no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n**CEAJournalToCKeyParent**\r\n\r\nThis property controls whether or child events are written to the journal of the synthetic parent event. Enabling this property is very useful to capture the events that pass through a group. This is important for forensic purposes, due to the transient nature of events. It also means an accurate record is captured for ticketing purposes. By default, all Netcool ticketing Gateways propagate journals automatically to the associated ticket, hence enabling this property is typically very useful indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, the journal (or \"Timeline\") of the synthetic parent event will look something like the following:\r\n\r\n![](images/alert.png)\r\n\r\nThis property is of type IntValue and has a default value of 0 (ie. disabled). It is disabled out-of-the-box because, although most likely this feature is desirable, it does consume resources to store this additional meta data, hence it must be enabled by the user.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAJournalToCKeyParent**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAJournalToCKeyParent';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **CEAJournalServerNameServerSerial**\r\n* **CEAJournalNode**\r\n* **CEAJournalAlertKey**\r\n* **CEAJournalSummary**\r\n* **CEAJournalCustomText**\r\n\r\nWhen journalling to the synthetic parent event is enabled, the following properties govern which of the default fields that are included for each journalled child event. By default, the **ServerSerial**, **ServerName**, **Node**, **AlertKey**, **Summary**, and **CustomText** fields are all included for each child event. These can be disabled as desired per the following example:\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update the journal related properties:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalServerNameServerSerial';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalNode';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalAlertKey';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalSummary';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalCustomText';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n**NOTE**: The `CustomText` field is empty by default and can be populated with any custom content that needs to be included - for example from custom fields - using a custom ObjectServer trigger.\r\n\r\n**CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry**\r\n\r\nFor efficiency, the Event Manager rolls multiple child events up into each journal entry, rather than creating a journal entry for each event. Each journal entry can hold a maximum of 4080 characters so care must be taken not to roll too many events up into a single journal entry, to avoid truncation happening. This property controls how many child events are rolled up into each journal entry and is set to 20 by default. This means the details from up to 20 events will be potentially added to each journal entry. For example, if 30 events need to be journalled to a synthetic parent event in a single cycle, it will split those across two journal entries therefore: 20 in one, and 10 in another.\r\n\r\nThis property may need to be tweaked, for example, if a large amount of information is to be included from the `CustomText` field. You may find that you need to reduce the number of events per journal entry to 10, for instance, where you are including significant amounts of additional `CustomText` content. Testing in a test environment will help you to optimise the value of this setting, to both maximise the number of events per entry, while avoiding truncation of entries at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 10 where Name = 'CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAMaxCKeyJournals**\r\n\r\nThis property specifies the maximum number of child events to journal to each synthetic parent event, and has a default value of 50. This property is important to prevent potentially vast number of journal entries from being created. Also, very often the probable cause events are going to be received within the first 50 or so anyway, so the rest would simply be symptomatic, which would not necessarily be very helpful in the context of a ticket. It may be that the organisation decides that they would like to have more or fewer events journalled for each group of events, for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAMaxCKeyJournals**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 75 where Name = 'CEAMaxCKeyJournals';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor reference, the grouping configuration properties are documented here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=analytics-configure-grouping-cloud-hybrid-deployments\r\n\r\n\r\n## 8-3: Review, configure, and import event housekeeping automations\r\n\r\nIn an environment that is being used for a Proof-Of-Concept, it is likely there will be a significant event flow into the Event Manager. For this reason, it is important to consider housekeeping automations to keep the overall event numbers under control. In this exercise, we will review, configure, and deploy a housekeeping automation to do this.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeping automations that ship with Netcool/OMNIbus can be found in the following directory location in the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n`/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/`\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\ncd /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/\r\nvim expiretime.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, we will configure and deploy the event expiry housekeeping automation. This automation will set **ExpireTime** for all events where it is not already set, except for parent events. The `ExpireTime` field is essentially a time-to-live (defined in seconds) and is used by the default expire automation to clear the events once they reach their expiry time. Events that have a zero value (ie. are unset) never expire, hence the need for such a housekeeping automation.\r\n\r\nThe event expire automation also generates a synthetic self-monitoring event into the ObjectServer, which can be viewed under the Database Table Usage bucket of the Netcool Health dashboard, giving a summary of how many events it has set `ExpireTime` for in the last cycle.\r\n\r\nAfter opening the `expiretime.sql` file with `vim`, make the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Change the **ENABLED** status of the **housekeeping_trigger** group to **TRUE**\r\n* Change the **ENABLED** status of the **hk_set_expiretime** trigger to **TRUE**\r\n* Add the following code of the **hk_set_expiretime** trigger as follows :\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nfor each row unexpired in alerts.status where\r\n    unexpired.ExpireTime = 0 and\r\n    unexpired.Severity != 0 and\r\n    unexpired.AlertGroup not in ('SiteNameParent', 'ScopeIDParent', 'Synthetic Event - Parent', 'CEACorrelationKeyParent')\r\n  begin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes enable the trigger and its group for use, and excludes the Event Manager parent events from consideration.\r\n\r\nSave your changes, and then apply the modified **expiretime.sql** file contents into your ObjectServer via the **nco_sql** utility.\r\n\r\nTo apply this trigger group and trigger to your system, log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/expiretime.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can verify that your automation is active by refreshing your **Alert** view, selecting a non-parent event, clicking on the **Information** tab, and scrolling down and verifying that the **ExpireTime** field is set to a non-zero value.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** You can uninstall this automation by importing the **expiretime_remove.sql** SQL file into your system in  the same way.\r\n\r\nFurther details of this and other out-of-the-box housekeeping automations can be found in the documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/netcoolomnibus/8.1?topic=netcoolomnibus-automating-housekeeping-tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n## 8.4: Create new Filters and Views\r\n\r\nOne of the key value capabilities in Event Manager is its ability to perform extensive event grouping. In order to better visualise the groupings that are occurring, it is helpful to create a number of additional filters to show this. It is also useful to modify the views to show additional fields that will come in useful in the course of a POC or evaluation. In this exercise, we will create two new Filters and amend the default View.\r\n\r\n**CREATE A CHILDREN FILTER**\r\n\r\nThis filter will allow you to see all child events individually, without the groupings being visible. This will give you a sense of the scale to which event grouping is helping you better visualise the events. You can then calculate the scale of the event reduction by comparing the number of groups versus the number of grouped events that would be individuals, if event grouping was not enabled.\r\n\r\nTo create a new Filter, log in to the Event Manager console, navigate to the **Alerts** view, and click on the **Edit filters** button.\r\n\r\nCreate a new Filter:\r\n\r\n* Click on the **New Filter** button\r\n* Make it globally available\r\n* Name it: **Children**\r\n* Set the **Default view** to: **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics**\r\n* Under **Filter Conditions**, click **Basic**\r\n* Select from the **Field** drop-down menu: **ParentIdentifier**\r\n* Select from the **Comparator** drop-down menu: **!=**\r\n* Enter the following value into the **Value** box: **''**\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your new Filter\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The Value box should contain two single quotes.\r\n\r\n**CREATE A GROUPS FILTER**\r\n\r\nThis filter will allow you to see all groups being created by the system, without all the individual events clogging your view.\r\n\r\nCreate a new filter:\r\n\r\n* Click on the **New Filter** button\r\n* Make it globally available\r\n* Name it: **Groups**\r\n* Set the Default view to: **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics**\r\n* Under **Filter Conditions**, click **Advanced**\r\n* Copy and past the following into the **SQL Where Clause** box:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nAlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent' or ParentIdentifier in (select Identifier from alerts.status where AlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent')\r\n```\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your new Filter\r\n\r\nThis filter says to include parent events (ie. ones where the **AlertGroup** is set to `'CEACorrelationKeyParent'`) or events where the **ParentIdentifier** field is linked to a parent event via the **Identifier** field of the parent.\r\n\r\nClick **Save and Close** to save your new filter\r\n\r\n**AMEND YOUR VIEW TO INCLUDE TTNumber**\r\n\r\nThe final step is to amend the default View to include the **TTNumber** field. This field is used by default by the Netcool ticketing Gateways to store ticket numbers from the target systems. It is also used in the event grouping automations in the propagation of ticket numbers from parent events down to children. In anticipation of setting up such an integration therefore, it is useful to add this field to the View.\r\n\r\nTo modify your View, log in to the Event Manager console, navigate to the **Alerts** view, and click on the **Edit views** button.\r\n\r\n* Select the **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics** View from the **System Views**\r\n* Select **TTNumber** from the **Available fields** and add it to the **Event list view**\r\n* Move it up in the list of fields so it is positioned just above the **Node** field\r\n* Change the **Column width** to 8 so it doesn't take up too much room in your Alerts view\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your View\r\n\r\n![](images/FilterView.png)\r\n\r\n## 8.5: Review and import optional trigger automations\r\n\r\nThis final section covers the addition of two optional changes to the ObjectServer. The first tweaks the behaviour of the generic clear automation and the second addresses a journalling point-of-note for when super-grouping occurs.\r\n\r\n**MODIFY GENERIC CLEAR**\r\n\r\nThe generic clear automation has been around since the foundations of Netcool/OMNIbus more than two decades ago. It is a simple but effective automation that automatically correlates problem events to resolution events and many of the Probes use this mechanism to achieve this. The logic in the generic clear will match a resolution event (Type = 2) to one or more problem events (Type = 1) where the following are true:\r\n\r\n* The Node field matches\r\n* The AlertKey matches\r\n* The AlertGroup matches\r\n* The Manager matches\r\n* The resolution event's timestamp is after the problem event's timestamp\r\n\r\nThere are many cases however where resolution events occur within the same one-second window as the problem event. An example is where a Probe has gone down but immediately been restarted by the Netcool Process Agent. In this case, you will likely have a critical problem alert informing that the Probe has disconnected, and a resolution event to say that the Probe has reconnected, both with the same timestamp. In this scenario therefore, the resolution event will not be matched to the problem event. In the course of processing, the resolution event will get cleared and deleted, meanwhile the problem event will remain.\r\n\r\nThe remedy to this is to tweak the code of the generic clear (line 24 below) so that instead of the **LastOccurrence** of the resolution event being greater-than (ie. after) the problem event's LastOccurrence, it is changed to be: greater-than-or-equal-to (ie. at the same time or after). This change means that any problem and resolution events that happen to occur within the same one-second window will still be correlated.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is also possible that in fact a resolution event is received, followed by a fresh problem event, but both in the same one-second window. In this case a modified generic clear automation will match and clear the problem event. This is the main reason why the default setting is the way it is, so that there is no chance of a problem event being cleared down incorrectly. In practice however, this scenario is extremely uncommon, whereas problem + resolution events being received in that order, in the same one-second window is quite common indeed.\r\n\r\nIf this alternative logic is preferable to the default, simply use the following SQL to replace the existing generic clear automation in your ObjectServer, using the method described earlier in this module:\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called: `/tmp/new_generic_clear.sql` and insert the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncreate or replace trigger generic_clear\r\ngroup primary_only\r\npriority 1\r\ncomment 'Generic Problem/Resolution'\r\nevery 5 seconds\r\nbegin\r\n-- Populate a table with Type 1 events corresponding to any uncleared Type 2 events\r\nfor each row problem in alerts.status where\r\nproblem.Type = 1 and problem.Severity > 0 and\r\n(problem.Node + problem.AlertKey + problem.AlertGroup + problem.Manager) in\r\n( select Node + AlertKey + AlertGroup + Manager from alerts.status where Severity > 0 and Type = 2 )\r\nbegin\r\ninsert into alerts.problem_events values ( problem.Identifier, problem.LastOccurrence, problem.AlertKey, problem.AlertGroup, problem.Node, problem.Manager, false );\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- For each resolution event, mark the corresponding problem_events entry as resolved\r\n-- and clear the resolution\r\nfor each row resolution in alerts.status where resolution.Type = 2 and resolution.Severity > 0\r\nbegin\r\nset resolution.Severity = 0;\r\nupdate alerts.problem_events set Resolved = true where\r\nLastOccurrence <= resolution.LastOccurrence and\r\nManager = resolution.Manager and Node = resolution.Node and\r\nAlertKey = resolution.AlertKey and AlertGroup = resolution.AlertGroup ;\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- Clear the resolved events\r\nfor each row problem in alerts.problem_events where problem.Resolved = true\r\nbegin\r\nupdate alerts.status via problem.Identifier set Severity = 0;\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- Remove all entries from the problems table\r\ndelete from alerts.problem_events;\r\nend;\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the the following command to import the SQL file that contains the tweaked `generic_clear` trigger into your ObjectServer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /tmp/new_generic_clear.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: In this lab, the job is done. In real world, you should make this change to both **AGG_P** and **AGG_B** as it will not be automatically replicated, unlike other properties covered in this module.\r\n\r\n**RESET JOURNALSENT FLAG WHEN SUPERGROUPING**\r\n\r\nThe event journalling feature covered in this module uses the **JournalSent** field in each child event to mark whether or not the child event has been written to the parent event's journal. When a child event is journalled, the flag is set to ensure it is not inadvertently journalled repeatedly. The Event Manager uses multiple methods for doing event grouping. One of the unique capabilities of Event Manager its ability to correlate events using different methods, and that an event can be a member of more than one event group at once. When this happens, the Event Manager merges the two groups together, replacing the existing synthetic parent events of the two groups to be merged with a new one. The old parent events then become children of the new parent and eventually disappear.\r\n\r\nIf events have already been written to the journal of the original parent event, the `JournalSent` flag will be set, meaning it will not be journalled again to the new parent to which it now belongs. The following trigger simply resets this flag if the system detects that a child event has been reassigned to a new parent event. This small tweak ensures that the new parent will get a copy of the child event's details in its journal.\r\n\r\nIf this tweak is desirable, use the following SQL to import this new automation into your ObjectServer.\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called: `/tmp/correlation_reset_journal_flag.sql` and insert the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER correlation_reset_journal_flag\r\nGROUP correlation_triggers\r\nPRIORITY 15\r\nCOMMENT 'Resets journal flag if parent changes'\r\nBEFORE UPDATE ON alerts.status\r\nFOR EACH ROW\r\nWHEN get_prop_value('ActingPrimary') %= 'TRUE' and\r\nold.ParentIdentifier != '' and\r\nnew.ParentIdentifier != '' and\r\nold.ParentIdentifier != new.ParentIdentifier\r\nbegin\r\n\r\n-- CHILD EVENT IS CHANGING PARENT SO RESET JournalSent FLAG\r\nset new.JournalSent = 0;\r\n\r\nend;\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the the following command to import the SQL file that contains the new `correlation_reset_journal_flag` trigger into your ObjectServer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /tmp/correlation_reset_journal_flag.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** You should import this trigger into both **AGG_P** and **AGG_B** as it will not be automatically replicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Reference Blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/07/14/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-77)\r\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9a3aeecc061950d27b5e2c41498bda3d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1038},"frontmatter":{"title":"Optional grouping features","description":"Configure optional grouping features to enhance grouping automation"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: Optional grouping features\r\ndescription: Configure optional grouping features to enhance grouping automation\r\n---\r\n<AnchorLinks>\r\n  <AnchorLink>8-1: Overview</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>8-2: Review and modify grouping automation properties</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>8-3: Review, configure, and import event housekeeping automations</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>8-4: Create new Filters and Views</AnchorLink>\r\n  <AnchorLink>8.5: Review and import optional trigger automations</AnchorLink>\r\n</AnchorLinks>\r\n\r\n## 8-1: Overview\r\n\r\nThis module looks at grouping automation options that can be configured via modifying properties in the ObjectServer table: **master.cea_properties**. We will focus on the properties that are typically most useful to enable of modify. This module also covers a few other final configuration points to consider when setting up a new environment, including installing housekeeping automations, setting up a few additional Filters and Views, and a couple of optional ObjectServer trigger modifications.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this module, you will have reviewed and possibly modified some of the grouping automation options, reviewed and installed housekeeping automations, created Filters and Views, and optionally made a couple of ObjectServer trigger modifications.\r\n\r\n## 8-2: Review and modify grouping automation properties\r\n\r\nThe ObjectServer is the name for the event database embedded within Watson for AIOps Event Manager that receives and stores events. It also provides trigger-based automation to enable additional capabilities, as well as to facilitate the implementation of custom automation. Part of the event grouping capabilities provided by Event Manager are implemented as triggers. There is a table in the ObjectServer called **master.cea_properties** that contains a number of user-modifiable properties that tweak the behaviours of the event grouping automation. This section highlights key ones that you may likely want to modify.\r\n\r\nThe **master.cea_properties** table has three main fields: **Name**, **IntValue**, and **CharValue**. Some of the properties refer to textual labels whereas most of them are either a boolean value (ie. 0 or 1) or are a numeric value. In the former case, the property will make use of the `CharValue` field, and in the latter case, the property will make use of the `IntValue` field.\r\n\r\nThe following properties should be reviewed and considered for modification, if desired.\r\n\r\n**CEACKeyPrefix**\r\n\r\nThis property specifies the prefix to be prepended to the Summary field of synthetic parent events. This property is of type CharValue and has a default value of \"GROUP\", which causes synthetic parent events to look like this in the Alerts view:\r\n\r\nDefault look like this:\r\n![](images/Summary1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter Modifying this setting:\r\n![](images/Summary2.png)\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEACKeyPrefix**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set CharValue = 'INCIDENT' where Name = 'CEACKeyPrefix';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent**\r\n\r\nBy default, all synthetic parent events will use a unique group identifier in its Node field. By enabling this property, the system will use the Node value of the first received event into the group instead, for the Node field of the synthetic parent.\r\n\r\nThe default looks like this:\r\n![](images/Node1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter enabling this setting:\r\n![](images/Node2.png)\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAUseNodeForCKeyParent';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAUseCKeyCustomText**\r\n\r\nBy default, the Summary field of the synthetic parent event follows the format:\r\n\r\n`<CEACKeyPrefix>: (N active events) <Summary-of-probable-cause-event>`\r\n\r\nIt is possible to append custom text to the end of this Summary string by first populating the `CustomText field` of the synthetic parent event and then enabling this property. By default it is disabled.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAUseCKeyCustomText**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAUseCKeyCustomText';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\nNOTE: If the `CustomText` field value is blank, then enabling this field will visibly have no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n**CEAJournalToCKeyParent**\r\n\r\nThis property controls whether or child events are written to the journal of the synthetic parent event. Enabling this property is very useful to capture the events that pass through a group. This is important for forensic purposes, due to the transient nature of events. It also means an accurate record is captured for ticketing purposes. By default, all Netcool ticketing Gateways propagate journals automatically to the associated ticket, hence enabling this property is typically very useful indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, the journal (or \"Timeline\") of the synthetic parent event will look something like the following:\r\n\r\n![](images/alert.png)\r\n\r\nThis property is of type IntValue and has a default value of 0 (ie. disabled). It is disabled out-of-the-box because, although most likely this feature is desirable, it does consume resources to store this additional meta data, hence it must be enabled by the user.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAJournalToCKeyParent**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 1 where Name = 'CEAJournalToCKeyParent';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **CEAJournalServerNameServerSerial**\r\n* **CEAJournalNode**\r\n* **CEAJournalAlertKey**\r\n* **CEAJournalSummary**\r\n* **CEAJournalCustomText**\r\n\r\nWhen journalling to the synthetic parent event is enabled, the following properties govern which of the default fields that are included for each journalled child event. By default, the **ServerSerial**, **ServerName**, **Node**, **AlertKey**, **Summary**, and **CustomText** fields are all included for each child event. These can be disabled as desired per the following example:\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update the journal related properties:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalServerNameServerSerial';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalNode';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalAlertKey';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalSummary';\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 0 where Name = 'CEAJournalCustomText';\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n**NOTE**: The `CustomText` field is empty by default and can be populated with any custom content that needs to be included - for example from custom fields - using a custom ObjectServer trigger.\r\n\r\n**CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry**\r\n\r\nFor efficiency, the Event Manager rolls multiple child events up into each journal entry, rather than creating a journal entry for each event. Each journal entry can hold a maximum of 4080 characters so care must be taken not to roll too many events up into a single journal entry, to avoid truncation happening. This property controls how many child events are rolled up into each journal entry and is set to 20 by default. This means the details from up to 20 events will be potentially added to each journal entry. For example, if 30 events need to be journalled to a synthetic parent event in a single cycle, it will split those across two journal entries therefore: 20 in one, and 10 in another.\r\n\r\nThis property may need to be tweaked, for example, if a large amount of information is to be included from the `CustomText` field. You may find that you need to reduce the number of events per journal entry to 10, for instance, where you are including significant amounts of additional `CustomText` content. Testing in a test environment will help you to optimise the value of this setting, to both maximise the number of events per entry, while avoiding truncation of entries at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 10 where Name = 'CEAJournalMaxEventsPerEntry';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CEAMaxCKeyJournals**\r\n\r\nThis property specifies the maximum number of child events to journal to each synthetic parent event, and has a default value of 50. This property is important to prevent potentially vast number of journal entries from being created. Also, very often the probable cause events are going to be received within the first 50 or so anyway, so the rest would simply be symptomatic, which would not necessarily be very helpful in the context of a ticket. It may be that the organisation decides that they would like to have more or fewer events journalled for each group of events, for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nTo modify this setting in `master.cae_properties`, use the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext log in into Objectserver via the `nco_sql` utility:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, execute the following SQL commands to update: **CEAMaxCKeyJournals**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nupdate master.cea_properties set IntValue = 75 where Name = 'CEAMaxCKeyJournals';\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor reference, the grouping configuration properties are documented here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=analytics-configure-grouping-cloud-hybrid-deployments\r\n\r\n\r\n## 8-3: Review, configure, and import event housekeeping automations\r\n\r\nIn an environment that is being used for a Proof-Of-Concept, it is likely there will be a significant event flow into the Event Manager. For this reason, it is important to consider housekeeping automations to keep the overall event numbers under control. In this exercise, we will review, configure, and deploy a housekeeping automation to do this.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeping automations that ship with Netcool/OMNIbus can be found in the following directory location in the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n`/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/`\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\ncd /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/\r\nvim expiretime.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, we will configure and deploy the event expiry housekeeping automation. This automation will set **ExpireTime** for all events where it is not already set, except for parent events. The `ExpireTime` field is essentially a time-to-live (defined in seconds) and is used by the default expire automation to clear the events once they reach their expiry time. Events that have a zero value (ie. are unset) never expire, hence the need for such a housekeeping automation.\r\n\r\nThe event expire automation also generates a synthetic self-monitoring event into the ObjectServer, which can be viewed under the Database Table Usage bucket of the Netcool Health dashboard, giving a summary of how many events it has set `ExpireTime` for in the last cycle.\r\n\r\nAfter opening the `expiretime.sql` file with `vim`, make the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Change the **ENABLED** status of the **housekeeping_trigger** group to **TRUE**\r\n* Change the **ENABLED** status of the **hk_set_expiretime** trigger to **TRUE**\r\n* Add the following code of the **hk_set_expiretime** trigger as follows :\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nfor each row unexpired in alerts.status where\r\n    unexpired.ExpireTime = 0 and\r\n    unexpired.Severity != 0 and\r\n    unexpired.AlertGroup not in ('SiteNameParent', 'ScopeIDParent', 'Synthetic Event - Parent', 'CEACorrelationKeyParent')\r\n  begin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes enable the trigger and its group for use, and excludes the Event Manager parent events from consideration.\r\n\r\nSave your changes, and then apply the modified **expiretime.sql** file contents into your ObjectServer via the **nco_sql** utility.\r\n\r\nTo apply this trigger group and trigger to your system, log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/extensions/housekeeping/expiretime.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can verify that your automation is active by refreshing your **Alert** view, selecting a non-parent event, clicking on the **Information** tab, and scrolling down and verifying that the **ExpireTime** field is set to a non-zero value.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** You can uninstall this automation by importing the **expiretime_remove.sql** SQL file into your system in  the same way.\r\n\r\nFurther details of this and other out-of-the-box housekeeping automations can be found in the documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/netcoolomnibus/8.1?topic=netcoolomnibus-automating-housekeeping-tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n## 8.4: Create new Filters and Views\r\n\r\nOne of the key value capabilities in Event Manager is its ability to perform extensive event grouping. In order to better visualise the groupings that are occurring, it is helpful to create a number of additional filters to show this. It is also useful to modify the views to show additional fields that will come in useful in the course of a POC or evaluation. In this exercise, we will create two new Filters and amend the default View.\r\n\r\n**CREATE A CHILDREN FILTER**\r\n\r\nThis filter will allow you to see all child events individually, without the groupings being visible. This will give you a sense of the scale to which event grouping is helping you better visualise the events. You can then calculate the scale of the event reduction by comparing the number of groups versus the number of grouped events that would be individuals, if event grouping was not enabled.\r\n\r\nTo create a new Filter, log in to the Event Manager console, navigate to the **Alerts** view, and click on the **Edit filters** button.\r\n\r\nCreate a new Filter:\r\n\r\n* Click on the **New Filter** button\r\n* Make it globally available\r\n* Name it: **Children**\r\n* Set the **Default view** to: **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics**\r\n* Under **Filter Conditions**, click **Basic**\r\n* Select from the **Field** drop-down menu: **ParentIdentifier**\r\n* Select from the **Comparator** drop-down menu: **!=**\r\n* Enter the following value into the **Value** box: **''**\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your new Filter\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The Value box should contain two single quotes.\r\n\r\n**CREATE A GROUPS FILTER**\r\n\r\nThis filter will allow you to see all groups being created by the system, without all the individual events clogging your view.\r\n\r\nCreate a new filter:\r\n\r\n* Click on the **New Filter** button\r\n* Make it globally available\r\n* Name it: **Groups**\r\n* Set the Default view to: **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics**\r\n* Under **Filter Conditions**, click **Advanced**\r\n* Copy and past the following into the **SQL Where Clause** box:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nAlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent' or ParentIdentifier in (select Identifier from alerts.status where AlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent')\r\n```\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your new Filter\r\n\r\nThis filter says to include parent events (ie. ones where the **AlertGroup** is set to `'CEACorrelationKeyParent'`) or events where the **ParentIdentifier** field is linked to a parent event via the **Identifier** field of the parent.\r\n\r\nClick **Save and Close** to save your new filter\r\n\r\n**AMEND YOUR VIEW TO INCLUDE TTNumber**\r\n\r\nThe final step is to amend the default View to include the **TTNumber** field. This field is used by default by the Netcool ticketing Gateways to store ticket numbers from the target systems. It is also used in the event grouping automations in the propagation of ticket numbers from parent events down to children. In anticipation of setting up such an integration therefore, it is useful to add this field to the View.\r\n\r\nTo modify your View, log in to the Event Manager console, navigate to the **Alerts** view, and click on the **Edit views** button.\r\n\r\n* Select the **Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics** View from the **System Views**\r\n* Select **TTNumber** from the **Available fields** and add it to the **Event list view**\r\n* Move it up in the list of fields so it is positioned just above the **Node** field\r\n* Change the **Column width** to 8 so it doesn't take up too much room in your Alerts view\r\n* Click **Save and Close** to save your View\r\n\r\n![](images/FilterView.png)\r\n\r\n## 8.5: Review and import optional trigger automations\r\n\r\nThis final section covers the addition of two optional changes to the ObjectServer. The first tweaks the behaviour of the generic clear automation and the second addresses a journalling point-of-note for when super-grouping occurs.\r\n\r\n**MODIFY GENERIC CLEAR**\r\n\r\nThe generic clear automation has been around since the foundations of Netcool/OMNIbus more than two decades ago. It is a simple but effective automation that automatically correlates problem events to resolution events and many of the Probes use this mechanism to achieve this. The logic in the generic clear will match a resolution event (Type = 2) to one or more problem events (Type = 1) where the following are true:\r\n\r\n* The Node field matches\r\n* The AlertKey matches\r\n* The AlertGroup matches\r\n* The Manager matches\r\n* The resolution event's timestamp is after the problem event's timestamp\r\n\r\nThere are many cases however where resolution events occur within the same one-second window as the problem event. An example is where a Probe has gone down but immediately been restarted by the Netcool Process Agent. In this case, you will likely have a critical problem alert informing that the Probe has disconnected, and a resolution event to say that the Probe has reconnected, both with the same timestamp. In this scenario therefore, the resolution event will not be matched to the problem event. In the course of processing, the resolution event will get cleared and deleted, meanwhile the problem event will remain.\r\n\r\nThe remedy to this is to tweak the code of the generic clear (line 24 below) so that instead of the **LastOccurrence** of the resolution event being greater-than (ie. after) the problem event's LastOccurrence, it is changed to be: greater-than-or-equal-to (ie. at the same time or after). This change means that any problem and resolution events that happen to occur within the same one-second window will still be correlated.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** It is also possible that in fact a resolution event is received, followed by a fresh problem event, but both in the same one-second window. In this case a modified generic clear automation will match and clear the problem event. This is the main reason why the default setting is the way it is, so that there is no chance of a problem event being cleared down incorrectly. In practice however, this scenario is extremely uncommon, whereas problem + resolution events being received in that order, in the same one-second window is quite common indeed.\r\n\r\nIf this alternative logic is preferable to the default, simply use the following SQL to replace the existing generic clear automation in your ObjectServer, using the method described earlier in this module:\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called: `/tmp/new_generic_clear.sql` and insert the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncreate or replace trigger generic_clear\r\ngroup primary_only\r\npriority 1\r\ncomment 'Generic Problem/Resolution'\r\nevery 5 seconds\r\nbegin\r\n-- Populate a table with Type 1 events corresponding to any uncleared Type 2 events\r\nfor each row problem in alerts.status where\r\nproblem.Type = 1 and problem.Severity > 0 and\r\n(problem.Node + problem.AlertKey + problem.AlertGroup + problem.Manager) in\r\n( select Node + AlertKey + AlertGroup + Manager from alerts.status where Severity > 0 and Type = 2 )\r\nbegin\r\ninsert into alerts.problem_events values ( problem.Identifier, problem.LastOccurrence, problem.AlertKey, problem.AlertGroup, problem.Node, problem.Manager, false );\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- For each resolution event, mark the corresponding problem_events entry as resolved\r\n-- and clear the resolution\r\nfor each row resolution in alerts.status where resolution.Type = 2 and resolution.Severity > 0\r\nbegin\r\nset resolution.Severity = 0;\r\nupdate alerts.problem_events set Resolved = true where\r\nLastOccurrence <= resolution.LastOccurrence and\r\nManager = resolution.Manager and Node = resolution.Node and\r\nAlertKey = resolution.AlertKey and AlertGroup = resolution.AlertGroup ;\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- Clear the resolved events\r\nfor each row problem in alerts.problem_events where problem.Resolved = true\r\nbegin\r\nupdate alerts.status via problem.Identifier set Severity = 0;\r\nend;\r\n\r\n-- Remove all entries from the problems table\r\ndelete from alerts.problem_events;\r\nend;\r\ngo\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the the following command to import the SQL file that contains the tweaked `generic_clear` trigger into your ObjectServer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /tmp/new_generic_clear.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: In this lab, the job is done. In real world, you should make this change to both **AGG_P** and **AGG_B** as it will not be automatically replicated, unlike other properties covered in this module.\r\n\r\n**RESET JOURNALSENT FLAG WHEN SUPERGROUPING**\r\n\r\nThe event journalling feature covered in this module uses the **JournalSent** field in each child event to mark whether or not the child event has been written to the parent event's journal. When a child event is journalled, the flag is set to ensure it is not inadvertently journalled repeatedly. The Event Manager uses multiple methods for doing event grouping. One of the unique capabilities of Event Manager its ability to correlate events using different methods, and that an event can be a member of more than one event group at once. When this happens, the Event Manager merges the two groups together, replacing the existing synthetic parent events of the two groups to be merged with a new one. The old parent events then become children of the new parent and eventually disappear.\r\n\r\nIf events have already been written to the journal of the original parent event, the `JournalSent` flag will be set, meaning it will not be journalled again to the new parent to which it now belongs. The following trigger simply resets this flag if the system detects that a child event has been reassigned to a new parent event. This small tweak ensures that the new parent will get a copy of the child event's details in its journal.\r\n\r\nIf this tweak is desirable, use the following SQL to import this new automation into your ObjectServer.\r\n\r\nUse the following command to log in into the `evtmanager-ncoprimary` pod:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called: `/tmp/correlation_reset_journal_flag.sql` and insert the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER correlation_reset_journal_flag\r\nGROUP correlation_triggers\r\nPRIORITY 15\r\nCOMMENT 'Resets journal flag if parent changes'\r\nBEFORE UPDATE ON alerts.status\r\nFOR EACH ROW\r\nWHEN get_prop_value('ActingPrimary') %= 'TRUE' and\r\nold.ParentIdentifier != '' and\r\nnew.ParentIdentifier != '' and\r\nold.ParentIdentifier != new.ParentIdentifier\r\nbegin\r\n\r\n-- CHILD EVENT IS CHANGING PARENT SO RESET JournalSent FLAG\r\nset new.JournalSent = 0;\r\n\r\nend;\r\ngo\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the the following command to import the SQL file that contains the new `correlation_reset_journal_flag` trigger into your ObjectServer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD  < /tmp/correlation_reset_journal_flag.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** You should import this trigger into both **AGG_P** and **AGG_B** as it will not be automatically replicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Reference Blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/07/14/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-77)\r\n","fileAbsolutePath":"C:/Users/103537778/git/waiops-tech-jam/src/pages/tutorials/aiops/optionalGrouping/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
