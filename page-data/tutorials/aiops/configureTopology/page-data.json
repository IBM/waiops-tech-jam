This module will use on the topology we created in the previous module.\n\nBy the end of this module, you will understand the three types of topology template, and have created an example of each type. You will also understand what a \"favourite\" is and will have added some items to your topology dashboard. Finally, you will have injected some sample events, and will observe them being grouped by the topology-based event grouping function.\n\nTopology group templates are used to create groups of resources. Resource groups make it easier to find and visualise collections of related resources, as well as do event correlation over resources in a group. There are three main types of topology group template:\n\n* Exact: defines a single group of specific resources\n* Tag-based: defines a single group of resources that share a common tag or tags\n* Dynamic: defines one or more groups that match a prescribed specification\n\nThe exact topology group template is useful for when you have a specific collection of resources that are unique in your environment that may be of particular importance. Perhaps you want to be able to find this group of resources quickly and easily, or visualise them on a wall screen.\n\nThe tag-based topology allows you to define a group of resources based on a common tag. These resources don't have to be connected; they simply need to have the common tag in order to be included. Tags can be added to resources via topology Rules set up in the GUI, or via the tags parameter if creating topology via the File or REST Observers.\n\nThe Dynamic template is probably the most versatile of the three topology group templates. Using an example of a set of resources you want to group, the dynamic topology group template will automatically find other groups of resources that follow the same \"recipe\" as the example you give. As you expose the resources and relationships in the view, the template builder records the steps, and then uses this recipe to find other similar groups of resources.\n\n## 6-2: Create an exact topology group template\n\nIn this exercise, we will create a template for a specific group of resources for our router (router1) and its connected resources.\n\nNavigate to: **Administration > Topology configuration > Group templates**\n\nClick on **Create a new template** and then select **Exact template**.\n\nYou will be presented with a **Template builder** window. From here, use the following steps to configure an exact template sample:\n\n* Give the template a name and provide a brief description\n* Choose the **Resource group type: network**\n* Add a **Resource group naming pattern prefix** for the resulting group's name: **ROUTER-**\n* Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template** if you want to correlate events across these resources\n* Type **router1** in the search box: **Search for a resource to get started** and hit Enter\n* Choose **router1** from the list of resources\n* Change the view to 1 hop and click **Render**\n* Click **Save template & generate resource group**\n\nYou should have something like the following:\n\n![](images/exact.png)\n\nAfter returning to the **Resource group templates** screen, you will see your saved template:\n\n![](images/resourcegroup.png)\n\n**NOTE:** An exact topology group template will only ever have 1 resource group.\n\nIf you navigate to Resource management and search for **ROUTER-** , you will see the following under the **Resource groups** tab:\n\n![](images/search.png)\n\nIf you click on the name **ROUTER-router1**, you will be able to view the topology group, which consists of 3 resources:\n\n![](images/router1.png)\n\n**NOTE**: if you have enabled event correlation across this group of resources and receive events from these resources, the events will be correlated automatically.\n\n## 6-3: Create a tag based topology template\n\nIn this exercise, we will create a template for group of resources based on their common tag.\n\nNavigate to: **Administration > Topology configuration > Group templates**\n\nClick on **Create a new template** and select **Tag based template**.\n\nYou will be presented with a **Template builder** window. From here, use the following steps to configure an tag based template sample:\n\n* Give the template a name and provide a brief description\n* Choose the **Resource group type: compute**\n* Add a **Resource group name** for the name of the group of resources: **WAIOpsDemoAssets**\n* Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template** if you want to correlate events across these resources\n* Type **WAIOpsDemo** in the search box: **Search for a tag to get started** and hit Enter\n* Check **WAIOpsDemo** from the list of available tags and then click the **Resources** tab to see the list of matching resources\n* Click **Save template & generate resource group**\n\nYou should have something like the following:\n\n![](images/tagbased.png)\n\nAfter returning to the **Resource group templates** screen, you will see your saved template:\n\n![](images/tagbasedsearch.png)\n\nIf you navigate to Resource management and search for **WAIOpsDemoAssets** , you will see the following under the **Resource groups** tab:\n\n![](images/tagresourcegrp.png)\n\nIf you click on the name **WAIOpsDemoAssets** , you will be able to view the topology group, which consists of 8 resources:\n\n![](images/tagrouter.png)\n\n## 6-4: Create a dynamic template\n\nIn this exercise, we will create a dynamic template to create groups of servers that host our applications. We will create a second server **computer1001** that hosts the **notification** and **email** applications for the purposes of this exercise.\n\nCreate a new file called application2.txt with the following contents:\n\n```sh\nV:{\"_operation\":\"InsertReplace\",\"uniqueId\":\"111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2\",\"matchTokens\":[\"111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2\",\"notifications\"],\"tags\":[\"WAIOpsDemo\"],\"name\":\"notifications\",\"entityTypes\":[\"application\"]}\nV:{\"_operation\":\"InsertReplace\",\"uniqueId\":\"111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2\",\"matchTokens\":[\"111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2\",\"email\"],\"tags\":[\"WAIOpsDemo\"],\"name\":\"email\",\"entityTypes\":[\"application\"]}\nV:{\"_operation\":\"InsertReplace\",\"uniqueId\":\"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2\",\"matchTokens\":[\"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2\",\"computer1001\"],\"tags\":[\"WAIOpsDemo\"],\"name\":\"computer1001\",\"entityTypes\":[\"computer\"]}\nE:{\"_toUniqueId\":\"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2\",\"_edgeType\":\"runsOn\",\"_fromUniqueId\":\"111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2\"}\nE:{\"_toUniqueId\":\"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2\",\"_edgeType\":\"runsOn\",\"_fromUniqueId\":\"111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2\"}\n```\nUse the steps included in the previous module to import this file into the Event Manager system and create a new File Observer job to ingest the topology data.\n\nNavigate to: **Administration > Topology configuration > Group templates**\n\nClick on **Create a new template** and select **Dynamic template**.\n\nYou will be presented with a **Template builder** window. From here, use the following steps to configure an tag based template sample:\n\n* Give the template a name and provide a brief description\n* Choose the **Resource group type: compute**\n* Add a **Resource group naming pattern** prefix for the resulting group's name: **APPSERVER-**\n* Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template** if you want to correlate events across these resources\n* Type **computer1000** in the search box: **Search for a resource to get started** and hit Enter\n* Choose **computer1000** from the list of available resources\n* Right-click on computer1000 and select **Follow Relationship → runsOn** which will expose the applications **webserver** and **billing**\n\nYou should have something like the following:\n\n![](images/dynamic.png)\n\nContinue with the following steps:\n\n* Scroll down on the left side and note that the template has been recording your actions to build a \"recipe\" for the template\n* Add a tag to the list of starting seeds if you want to restrict the items matched by this template to just those tagged with specific tags\n* Continue to scroll down and click **Save template & generate resource group**\n\n![](images/dynamic_def.png)\n\nYou should see that the dynamic template builder has found two groups of resources that match the specification:\n\n![](images/dynamic_result.png)\n\n## 6-5: Inject test events and observe event grouping\n\nSQL can be injected into the ObjectServer to generate test events that will match the topology groups created in previous steps. \n\nCreate a local file called `sample_events.sh` on the machine you are running your terminal session from and paste in the following contents:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/nco_sql -server AGG_P -user root -passwd $OMNIBUS_ROOT_PWD << EOF\n\ninsert into alerts.status (Identifier, Node, Summary, Severity, Type, AlertGroup) values ('cpu01', 'cpu01', 'cpu01 on computer1000 >90% utilisation', 5, 1, 'VMware');\ninsert into alerts.status (Identifier, Node, Summary, Severity, Type, AlertGroup) values ('cpu02', 'cpu02', 'cpu02 on computer1000 >80% utilisation', 4, 1, 'VMware');\ninsert into alerts.status (Identifier, Node, Summary, Severity, Type, AlertGroup) values ('billing', 'billing', 'Billing application ResponseTime >10000msec', 4, 1, 'Instana');\ninsert into alerts.status (Identifier, Node, Summary, Severity, Type, AlertGroup) values ('webserver', 'webserver', 'Webserver service degraded', 5, 1, 'Instana');\ngo\nexit\n\nEOF\n\n```\nUse the following command to copy your new script to the ObjectServer pod in your OpenShift cluster:\n\n```sh\ncat sample_events.sh | oc exec -i evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 -- sh -c \"cat > /tmp/sample_events.sh\"\n```\n\n```sh\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash -- sh -c \"chmod +x /tmp/sample_events.sh\"\n```\n\nFinally, use the following command to execute the script, to inject synthetic events into the system:\n\n```sh\noc exec -it evtmanager-ncoprimary-0 bash -- /tmp/sample_events.sh\n```\n\nYou can ignore the message: `Warning: Failed to find tar in the following directories : /bin /usr/bin`\n\nAfter completing these steps, waiting a few moments and refresh your Event Viewer. You should see a group containing the events generated by your script. If you click on the **Correlation Information** button, and then one of the buttons in the topology-based correlation column, you'll see a preview of the topology based group that has caused the correlation of these events:\n\n![](images/correlation.png)\n\n## 6-6: View results in Topology Dashboard\n\nNavigate to: **Resource management > Resource groups**. Browse your defined groups and click on the small heart icon to the right of each on a selection of the groups. Favourite some groups that have some associated underlying events. You'll notice that your favourite groups of resources automatically appear at the top of the screen.\n\nNavigate to: **Dashboards > Topology dashboard**. This will open the topology dashboard with any groups of resources you have made a favourite.\n\n![](images/topo_dashboard.png)\n\nNote how two of the groupings have a red and orange halo of colour around them. This is because of the underlying events we created in the previous step, that have now been associated with some of the underlying resources. If you click on one of the groupings, it will show you a preview of the topology group, and a summary of **Status severity breakdown**, as well as **Topology churn**. Clicking on **Open full view** will take you into the full topology view for the selected topology group, where you can then get a fuller view of the affected topology resources.\n\nYou have now completed this module and are ready for module \"Configure scope-based grouping\".\n\n[Reference Blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/04/26/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-57)\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9cdc135ff9022c8eded47a0e57bfd57d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":908},"frontmatter":{"title":"Configure topology group templates","description":"Create and configure topology group templates"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Configure topology group templates\ndescription: Create and configure topology group templates\n---\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>6-1: Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6-2: Create an exact topology group template</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6-3: Create a tag based topology template</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6-4: Create a dynamic template</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6-5: Inject test events and observe event grouping</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6-6: View results in Topology Dashboard</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## 6-1: Overview\n\nThis module focuses on topology group templates, the different types, and what each is used for, including for topology-based event correlation.
