The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen.  Some of the sections have dependencies on the previous section.\n\n- First, you will be learning how to install a **single server self-hosted** installation of the Instana Server.\n- Then, you will learn how to Install the Instana Agent into a variety of environments (OpenShift, Docker, and Linux server)\n- You will next learn to install the **Robot Shop** application into an OpenShift cluster.  This includes configuring Website Monitoring\n- Next, you will learn how to setup the Monitoring sensors for **IBM MQ** and **IBM App Connect Enterprise \\(ACE\\)**\n- Once you have the applications intrumented with Instana sensors, you will go through a serious of exercises to explore Instana's capabilities.\n- Finally, you will learn how to use some of Instana's Administrative capabilities.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1dbb52f14bc3e24b470cee7b2a812bf7","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":893},"frontmatter":{"title":"1 - Instana","description":"Instana Lab"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: 1 - Instana \ndescription: Instana Lab\n---\n\n##  Introduction\n\nIn the Instana portion of the Tech Jam lab, you will be going through several key exercises in order to learn more about Instana.
