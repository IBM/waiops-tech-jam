An **Alert Channel** is a mechanism that is used to get Events out of Instana and into another system when the Events trigger.  There are a variety of **Alert Channels** including email notifications, slack, Watson AIOps, and more. In this section we'll show you how to setup and **Alert Channel**.  Later, in the Administrative section, we'll use that **Alert Channel** to get a notification when an Event triggers.\n\nBegin by selecting the **Settings** gear in the left side navigation.  Then, select **Alert Channel**\n\n![](images/alertChannel2.png)\n\nThe screen will change to show the **Alert Channels**.  Since this is a new install of Instana, there are no **Alert Channels** define.  \n\nThe next step will be to define an **Alert Channel**.  In the upper left portion of the screen, click on the **Add Alert Channel** dropdown and select **Email**\n\n![](images/email.png)\n\nNotice that there are several different types of **Alert Channels** to integrate **Events** into a variety of solutions.  The **Generic Webhook** is the most flexible and supports integration into an number of tools like ServiceNow that support Webhooks.\n\nAfter selecting **Email** the screen will change to show the fields required to configure the **Email** **Alert Channel**.  An **Alert Channel** can be setup to notify very specific users or it can be setup to notify large groups of users.  For example, you might want all database related Events to be sent to an **Email** alias for the DBAs.  Or, you might want to notify a specific line of business or the IT Operations team.  \n\nHere are the steps for setting up the **Email** channel.\n- Enter a name for the alert. The name can be anything, but should be meaningful.  For example, if the **Alert Channel** will be used to notify the MQ admins, call it something MQ related such as **MQ Email Channel**\n- Enter the email address to notify.  Notice that there is an **Add Email** link on the right side if you want to add multiple Email addresses.\n- Next, click the **Test Channel** button.  This will attempt to send a test Email to the address you specified.  You'll see whether the Instana server has access to the Email destination.\n- After successfully testing the **Alert Channel**, click the **Create button to save the **Alert Channel**\n\n***\n\n# 7-2:  Create an Analytics Based Smart Alert\n\nIn this section, students are going to create an analytics based **\"Smart Alert\"** to detect abnormal behavior within an application.\n\nClick on Applications.  Then, select the **\"Quote of the Day\"** application. \n\nNote, you can't use the application that you just installed for Analytics based threshold because\nthere isn't enough historical data.\n![](images/applicationsQOTD.png)\n\n\nClick on **\"Add Smart Alert\"** in the lower right corner.\n\n![](images/smartAlert.png)\n\n\nThere is a simple and an advanced mode.  We'll be using the advanced mode which allows you to see all of the capabilities.\n\nIn the upper right corner of the dialog, select **\"Switch to Advanced Mode\"**\n![](images/advanced.png)\n\nIn the upper left corner, you'll see that there are 4 different types of **Smart Alerts**\n- Slow Calls\n- Erroneous Calls\n- HTTP Status Codes\n- Throughput (both high and low numbers of calls)\n\nLeave the default of **\"Slow Calls\"**\n![](images/slowCalls.png)\n\nScroll down.  You'll see that there are number of options to determine which calls you want to analyze.  \n- You can analyze the calls for this application or you can analyze specific services or endpoints.\n- You can analyze **Inbound Calls** or **All Calls**\n- You can include **Internal Calls**\n- You can include **Synthetic Calls**\n\n![](images/options4.png)\n\nLeave the default settings.\n\nScroll down further until you see the widgets show in the screen capture below.\n![](images/options2.png)\n\nYou'll notice that there are a variety of options including:\n- The ability to change the percentile that is used for the evaluation\n- The type of seasonality (static, daily, or weekly)\n- whether you want to view the last 24 hours or 7 days of historical data\n- Sensitivity.\n\nTry out some of the options, but keep in mind that analytics based thresholds will require a week of data and your system has only been running for a few hours.\n\n\nTry moving the slider for sensitivity.  Notice that when you set it to higher sensitivity, the number of red triangles show on the screen will change.\nThese red triangles indicate when thresholds would trigger if you had chosen that setting.\n![](images/sensitivity.png)\n\nChoose an appropriate value for the sensitivity.  You don't want to receive a lot of alert by setting the sensitivity too high.  Usually, if you see more than 1 or two alerts per day,\nthe sensitivity is probably too high.  But, it depends on the historical data that you're looking at and the mission criticality of the application.\n\nScroll down further.\n![](images/options3.png)\n\nYou'll see that there are options for persistence over time.  This ensures that the conditions trigger for a reasonable length of time before an alert is raised.  \n\nThere is also an option to select an **\"Alert Channel\"**.  In the previous section, you created an Email Alert Channel.\n\nSelect the **\"Select Alert Channels\"** option.  A dialog will open with the **Alert Channel** that you created earlier.  Select the channel.  \n\nNote:  It is possible to select multiple **Alert Channels**.  For example, you can notify people via Email and Slack.   Or, let's assume there is a database Event, you can notify the DBAs and you can notify that line of business that uses the database.\n\nScroll further down on the page and you'll see a section titled **Additional Alert Properties**\n\n![](images/alertProperties.png)\n\nIn this section you will notice that there is a default title and description.  You can edit those fields and replace them with custom messages.  As you type the **Title** and **Description**, the upper right corner will update with a sample of what the Event will look like when it triggers.   There are other options such as setting the **Alert Level** and whether or not the Event should be aggregated into an **Incident**.\n\nFill in the fields as you desire.  Then, click the ** Create** button to create the **Smart Alert**\n\nThe **Smart Alert** dialog will close and you'll be back in the context of your application.   To see the **Smart Alert** that you just created, click on the **Smart Alerts** tab at the top of the screen.  \n![](images/viewSmartAlerts.png)\n\n***\n\n# 7-3:  Create a Static Threshold (Event)\nNow, let's examine how a more traditional threshold is created and used in conjunction with Alert Channels.\n\nOn the left side of the screen, select the **\"Settings\"** gear.\n![](images/events.png)\n\nThe Settings menu provides access to most of the administrative tasks within Instana.  You'll notice menus for Events, Alerts, Alert Channels, API Tokens, Users, Groups, Log Managemnet Integration, and more\n\nSelect **\"Events\"**\n\nOnce you click on **\"Events\"**, you will see a list of 300+ Events that are defined as out of the box thresholds within Instana.  If you want to filter the list, you can do that in a number of ways\nvia the drop down lists at the top of the page.\n![](images/filterEvents.png)\n\nNotice that you can filter based on the Event type, severity, entity type, state, or simply enter a keyword filter.\n\nLet's select **\"Entity Type\"**\n\nSelect the **\"Entity Type\"** dropdown list and type **\"IBM MQ\"** into the field.  You'll notice that a few different options show up. Each of the options is an Entity Type.  You can filter \non the Events related to the IBM MQ Queue Manager, Queue, Channel, etc.\n\nSelect **\"IBM MQ Queue Manager\"** from the dropdown list.\n![](images/qmEvents.png)\n\nThis will filter the Events to the list of Events that are written against the IBM MQ Queue Manager entity type.  There are several out of the box threshold Events that will detect things like\nchannel initiator status, queue manager status, publish/subscribe engine status, and more.\n\nLet's create a new Event.\n\nAt the top of the screen, select the **\"+ New Event\"** link.\n![](images/newEvent.png)\n\nFill in the following information for you new Event:\n- Give your Event a name. \n- Enter a description for the Event\n- Select a severity (Warning or critical)\n- Select the option of whether you want your Event to get correlated into Incidents\n- Select a Grace Period.   \n![](images/newEvent1.png)\n\nThe Grace Period is a capability that allow you to avoid getting multiple alerts during flapping.  Let's say you are monitoring for high CPU utilization on a server.  If CPU utilization goes High, then Low, then High over a short period of time, you typically only want to see **ONE** event.  By setting a \"Grace Period\" of something like 60 seconds, you would only receive 1 Event during that interval.\n\nNow, scroll down a little further and fill in the remaining options.\n\nIn the **\"Condition\"** section, select the dropdown and choose **\"Built-in Metrics\"**.  Most of your thresholds will be written against these **Built-in Metrics**.  \n![](images/newEvent2.png)\n\nThe choice of \"Custom metrics\" would only apply to custom metrics that are being fed into Instana.  The \"System Rules\" are a specialized set of rules for doing thing like detecting that an entity is **\"offline\"**.\n\nOnce you select **\"Built-in Metrics\"** another dropdown list will appear.  The new dropdown list is asking for the **\"Entity type\"** that you are going to write your threshold against.\n\nIn the **\"Entity type\"** dropdown, select **\"IBM MQ Queue\"**.  Notice that you can type in letters such as \"IBM MQ\" to filter the list.\n![](images/newEvent3.png)\n\nAfter specifying an **\"Entity type\"**, a new dropdown appears with a list of available **\"Metrics\"**.  Select the **\"Metric\"** dropdown and choose **\"Depth > Queue Depth Percentage\"**.\n![](images/newEvent4.png)\n\nAfter making your select, some new dropdowns appear on the screen looking for the following information:\n- Time Window:  This is the duration that you want to monitor and evaluate\n- Aggregation:  Since Instana is capture data at a high interval, you can use Min, Max, Avg, Sum as part of your evaluation.  \n- Operator: What type of evaluation do you want to do (>, < =, etc.)\n- Percentage - This field is actually different depending on the metric you are evaluating. In this case, you are evaluating a metric that is a percentage.\n\nIn the dropdowns, choose **\"60 s\"** for the time window, **\"max\"** for the Aggregation, **\">\"** for the Operator, and **\"90\"** for the Percentage.\n![](images/newEvent5.png)\n\nThis will cause the threshold to evaluate the **Queue Depth Percent** for 60 seconds and determine whether the maximum value during that interval exceeded 90%.  If it did exceed 90%, then the Event will trigger.\n\nNow you have to select the **\"Scope\"** that this threshold will apply to.  Select the dropdown list.\n![](images/allEntities.png)\n\nIn the dropdown list, you'll see the following options:\n- You have the option of applying this threshold to an **\"Application Perspective\"**. This would limit the scope of the threshold to a specific application.\n- You can use a **\"Dynamic Focus Query\"** to filter to a specific list of MQ Queues.\n- Or, you can have your threshold apply to **\"All Available Entities\"**.\n\nLet's make this a global Event and choose the **\"All Available Entities\"** option.\n\nClick the **\"Create\"** button to save your new Event.\n\nNote:  If you wanted to apply your Event to a subset of the MQ Queues, you would specify a Dynamic Focus Query.  The query would look something like this. \n![](images/dynamicFocusQuery.png) \n\nThe easiest way to formulate a **Dynamic Focus Query** is to go to the **Infrastructure** page and build a filter.  It will guide you through the options. Then, copy and paste the string into the **Event** editor.\n![](images/infrastructure2.png) \n\nA **Dynamic Focus Query** can be a complex expression using AND, OR, NOT, etc. to filter to a subset of the entities. These queries are build using the **Lucene** query language.  For more information on the **Lucene** query language, see the project documentation.  [Lucenes Query Language](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-filtering-dynamic-focus)\n\n***\n# 7-4:  Setting up an Offline Event\n\nA common monitoring scenario is to setup an **Offline** Event to detect an Entity going offline.  We're going to create an **Event** that will detect any **Host** that goes offline.  \n\nTo do this, create a new static **Event**.   When you create the event, select **System Rules** as the **Source**.  Then, select **Offline event detection** for the **System Rule**\n\n![](images/systemEvent.png)\n\nNext, select the scope.   Choose **Selected Enties Only (Dynamic Focus Query)**.  \n\nIn the **Dynamic Focus Query**, you are going to specify something a little different.  Instead of choosing **Entity.type:host**, we are going to use **entity.selfType:host**. The reason for this is that **entity.type:host** will filter on all of the hosts, but will also include the child entities that are running on the host.  We only want to detect that the **Host** is offline.  Therefore, we are going to specify **entity.selfType:host**.\n\nCopy and post the string into the Event definition.\n```sh\nentity.selfType:host\n```\n\nYour **Dynamic Focus Query** should look like this.\n![](images/selfType.png)\n\nClick the Create button to save your Event.\n\nIf you want to see how **entity.type:host** vs. **entity.selfType:host** behaves, you can open the Infrastructure view and add the queries into the search bar and see the results.  You'll see the same list of hosts returned within the UI.  But, when you use **selfType**, you'll notice that the server towers do not contain the **pizza boxes** representing each of the **Entities**.\n\n![](images/selfType2.png)\n\n\n***\n\n# 7-5:  Setup an Alert for the New Event\n\nNow that you have a new Event defined, you need to define and Alert.  Alerts are used to notify people and teams via various Alert Channels.  You previously\nreviewed the options for Alert Channels.  The Alerts will be sent to one or more Alert Channels that you select.\n\nSelect **\"Settings\"** on the left side navigation.  Then select **\"Alerts\"** \n![](images/alerts.png)\n\nClick on the **\"+ New Alert\"** link \n![](images/newAlert.png)\n\nGive the new **\"Alert\"** a name.  Normally, the **Alert** name is something meaningful to indicate who will be notified and the type of events being sent.  For example, **MQ Alerts**\n\nSelect the dropdown labeled **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**\n![](images/alertOnEvents.png)\n\nYou will see that there are multiple options.  You can setup an Alert for a particular Entity Type.  For example, you might setup an Alert for all Oracle Database Events.\n\nIn your case, select **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**.  This option allows you to select a specific list of Events to forward to an Alert Channel(s).\n\nFurther down on the page, select the **\"Add Events\"** link.\n![](images/addEvent.png)\n\nInitially, you will see a list of ALL Events.\n\nLet's filter the list to just a specific **Entity Type**.   Select the **\"Entity Type\"** dropdown list and select **\"IBM MQ Queue\"**\n![](images/filterQueue.png)\n\nYou will now see a filtered list of Events related to IBM MQ Queues.   Find the Event you created in the previous section and select the checkbox.   Then, select the **\"Add 1 Event\"** button at the bottom.\n![](images/chooseEvent.png)\n\nYou will now see the 1 selected Event listed.  Further down on the screen you will see a **\"Scope\"** section.  This determines which Entities this Alert will apply to.\n![](images/scope.png)\n\nSelect the **\"Apply on\"** dropdown list. You'll see that you can choose one of 3 options:\n- Application Perspective:  This option allows you to limit the scope of the alert to a specific application.\n- Selected Entities Only:  You use the dynamic focus queries to filter to a specific set of Entities\n- All Available Entities:  The Alert would apply to any Entity that triggered the Event threshold.\n\nSelect the **\"Selected Entities Only\"** option\n![](images/selectedEntities.png)\n\nA new widget will appear on the right side of the screen asking you to specify the **\"Dynamic Focus Query\"**\n\nIn the entry field, enter the lucene query that will filter to the queue that is used for the **Quote of the Day** application.  Enter the following value:\n```sh\nentity.ibmmq.queue.name:CP4I.DEMO.API.Q\n```\n![](images/CP4I.DEMO.API.Q.png)\n\nThese lucene queries can be complex sequences of AND and OR statements.  In this case, we are looking for 1 specific queue.\n\nNext, click on the **\"+ Add Alert Channels\"** link\n![](images/alertChannel.png)\n\nA dialog will open with a list of available **\"Alert Channels\"**.  Select the **Alert Channel** that you created earlier.\n\nThen, click the **\"Add 1 Channel\"** button.\n![](images/selectChannel.png)\n\nScroll down to the bottom. You will see an optional section where you can add custom payloads by adding Key/Value pairs.  We're going to skip that section.\n\nFinally, click the **\"Create\"** button to save your Alert.\n![](images/saveAlert.png)\n\nThat completes this section of the lab.\n\n***\n\n# 7-6:  Summary\n\nAt this point, you have created an Event and an Alert for that Event.  The next time the custom **\"Event\"** that you created triggers, an **\"Alert\"** will be sent to the **Alert Channel**.  In this case, a Email will be sent.\n\nIn this section of the lab, you learned how to create a Smart Alert, a traditional Alert (Event), and learned how these Alerts are routed to the correct people/teams via Alert Channels.\n\n\n***\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1da8c5c59e9a16aa9bf07fd5c887255f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":926},"frontmatter":{"title":"Section 6 - Administer Instana","description":"Perform Administrative Functions with Instana"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Section 6 - Administer Instana\ndescription: Perform Administrative Functions with Instana\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>7-1: Create an Alert Channel</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>7-2: Create an Analytics Based Smart Alert</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>7-3: Create a Static Threshold (Event)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>7-4: Setting up an Offline Event</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>7-5: Setup an Alert for the New Event</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>7-6: Summary</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n# 7-1:  Create an Alert Channel\n\ntesting\n\n\nIn order to notify people when problems occur in an Instana environment, you must first have an **Alert Channel**.

If it did exceed 90%, then the Event will trigger.\n\nNow you have to select the **\"Scope\"** that this threshold will apply to.  Select the dropdown list.\n![](images/allEntities.png)\n\nIn the dropdown list, you'll see the following options:\n- You have the option of applying this threshold to an **\"Application Perspective\"**. This would limit the scope of the threshold to a specific application.\n- You can use a **\"Dynamic Focus Query\"** to filter to a specific list of MQ Queues.\n- Or, you can have your threshold apply to **\"All Available Entities\"**.\n\nLet's make this a global Event and choose the **\"All Available Entities\"** option.\n\nClick the **\"Create\"** button to save your new Event.\n\nNote:  If you wanted to apply your Event to a subset of the MQ Queues, you would specify a Dynamic Focus Query.  The query would look something like this. \n![](images/dynamicFocusQuery.png) \n\nThe easiest way to formulate a **Dynamic Focus Query** is to go to the **Infrastructure** page and build a filter.  It will guide you through the options. Then, copy and paste the string into the **Event** editor.\n![](images/infrastructure2.png) \n\nA **Dynamic Focus Query** can be a complex expression using AND, OR, NOT, etc. to filter to a subset of the entities. These queries are build using the **Lucene** query language.  For more information on the **Lucene** query language, see the project documentation.  [Lucenes Query Language](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-filtering-dynamic-focus)\n\n***\n# 7-4:  Setting up an Offline Event\n\nA common monitoring scenario is to setup an **Offline** Event to detect an Entity going offline.  We're going to create an **Event** that will detect any **Host** that goes offline.  \n\nTo do this, create a new static **Event**.   When you create the event, select **System Rules** as the **Source**.  Then, select **Offline event detection** for the **System Rule**\n\n![](images/systemEvent.png)\n\nNext, select the scope.   Choose **Selected Enties Only (Dynamic Focus Query)**.  \n\nIn the **Dynamic Focus Query**, you are going to specify something a little different.  Instead of choosing **Entity.type:host**, we are going to use **entity.selfType:host**. The reason for this is that **entity.type:host** will filter on all of the hosts, but will also include the child entities that are running on the host.  We only want to detect that the **Host** is offline.  Therefore, we are going to specify **entity.selfType:host**.\n\nCopy and post the string into the Event definition.\n```sh\nentity.selfType:host\n```\n\nYour **Dynamic Focus Query** should look like this.\n![](images/selfType.png)\n\nClick the Create button to save your Event.\n\nIf you want to see how **entity.type:host** vs. **entity.selfType:host** behaves, you can open the Infrastructure view and add the queries into the search bar and see the results.  You'll see the same list of hosts returned within the UI.  But, when you use **selfType**, you'll notice that the server towers do not contain the **pizza boxes** representing each of the **Entities**.\n\n![](images/selfType2.png)\n\n\n***\n\n# 7-5:  Setup an Alert for the New Event\n\nNow that you have a new Event defined, you need to define and Alert.  Alerts are used to notify people and teams via various Alert Channels.  You previously\nreviewed the options for Alert Channels.  The Alerts will be sent to one or more Alert Channels that you select.\n\nSelect **\"Settings\"** on the left side navigation.  Then select **\"Alerts\"** \n![](images/alerts.png)\n\nClick on the **\"+ New Alert\"** link \n![](images/newAlert.png)\n\nGive the new **\"Alert\"** a name.  Normally, the **Alert** name is something meaningful to indicate who will be notified and the type of events being sent.  For example, **MQ Alerts**\n\nSelect the dropdown labeled **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**\n![](images/alertOnEvents.png)\n\nYou will see that there are multiple options.  You can setup an Alert for a particular Entity Type.  For example, you might setup an Alert for all Oracle Database Events.\n\nIn your case, select **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**.  This option allows you to select a specific list of Events to forward to an Alert Channel(s).\n\nFurther down on the page, select the **\"Add Events\"** link.\n![](images/addEvent.png)\n\nInitially, you will see a list of ALL Events.\n\nLet's filter the list to just a specific **Entity Type**.   Select the **\"Entity Type\"** dropdown list and select **\"IBM MQ Queue\"**\n![](images/filterQueue.png)\n\nYou will now see a filtered list of Events related to IBM MQ Queues.   Find the Event you created in the previous section and select the checkbox.   Then, select the **\"Add 1 Event\"** button at the bottom.\n![](images/chooseEvent.png)\n\nYou will now see the 1 selected Event listed.  Further down on the screen you will see a **\"Scope\"** section.  This determines which Entities this Alert will apply to.\n![](images/scope.png)\n\nSelect the **\"Apply on\"** dropdown list. You'll see that you can choose one of 3 options:\n- Application Perspective:  This option allows you to limit the scope of the alert to a specific application.\n- Selected Entities Only:  You use the dynamic focus queries to filter to a specific set of Entities\n- All Available Entities:  The Alert would apply to any Entity that triggered the Event threshold.\n\nSelect the **\"Selected Entities Only\"** option\n![](images/selectedEntities.png)\n\nA new widget will appear on the right side of the screen asking you to specify the **\"Dynamic Focus Query\"**\n\nIn the entry field, enter the lucene query that will filter to the queue that is used for the **Quote of the Day** application.  Enter the following value:\n```sh\nentity.ibmmq.queue.name:CP4I.DEMO.API.Q\n```\n![](images/CP4I.DEMO.API.Q.png)\n\nThese lucene queries can be complex sequences of AND and OR statements.  In this case, we are looking for 1 specific queue.\n\nNext, click on the **\"+ Add Alert Channels\"** link\n![](images/alertChannel.png)\n\nA dialog will open with a list of available **\"Alert Channels\"**.  Select the **Alert Channel** that you created earlier.\n\nThen, click the **\"Add 1 Channel\"** button.\n![](images/selectChannel.png)\n\nScroll down to the bottom. You will see an optional section where you can add custom payloads by adding Key/Value pairs.  We're going to skip that section.\n\nFinally, click the **\"Create\"** button to save your Alert.\n![](images/saveAlert.png)\n\nThat completes this section of the lab.\n\n***\n\n# 7-6:  Summary\n\nAt this point, you have created an Event and an Alert for that Event.  The next time the custom **\"Event\"** that you created triggers, an **\"Alert\"** will be sent to the **Alert Channel**.  In this case, a Email will be sent.\n\nIn this section of the lab, you learned how to create a Smart Alert, a traditional Alert (Event), and learned how these Alerts are routed to the correct people/teams via Alert Channels.\n\n\n***\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/amar/workspace/git-repos/github.com/IBM/waiops-tech-jam/src/pages/tutorials/instana/administer/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
