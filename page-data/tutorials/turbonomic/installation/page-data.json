Login into the **AIops** OpenShift Console UI and get your login token:\n\n   - From the OpenShift console, click your username in the top-right.\n   - Select the _Copy login command_ menu item.\n   - From the new tab that opens, copy the login command from the\n     **Log in with this token** section.\n   - Paste the copied command into your SSH terminal on your control node and\n     press enter to login.\n\n   Validate you are logged into the correct cluster - you should see **6 nodes**:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc get nodes\n   ```\n\n1. From your command prompt, issue the following command to create the namespace:\n\n   ```sh\n   export NS=turbonomic\n   oc create namespace ${NS}\n   ```\n\n1. The Turbonomic application will create PVs. To have the services access their PVs, we will use the UID value of the `sa.scc.uid-range` of the project:\n\n   ```sh\n   export FSGROUP=$(\n       oc get ns ${NS} -o yaml | \\\n       grep uid-range | \\\n       awk '{print $2}' | \\\n       awk -F '/' '{print $1}'\n   )\n   ```\n\n1. Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to allow Turbo operator to deploy all the necessary resources\n\n   - For Kubernetes version 1.22 and higher (To check the Kubernetes version, you can run `oc version` command):\n\n     ```sh\n     oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbonomic/t8c-install/master/operator/config/crd/bases/charts.helm.k8s.io_xls.yaml\n     ```\n\nYou are now ready to deploy the operator\n\n---\n\n## 2-3: Deploy the Operator\n\n1. Create the operator service account:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbonomic/t8c-install/master/operator/deploy/service_account.yaml -n ${NS}\n   ```\n\n1. Create the cluster role:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbonomic/t8c-install/master/operator/deploy/cluster_role.yaml -n ${NS}\n   ```\n\n1. Create the role binding:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbonomic/t8c-install/master/operator/deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml -n ${NS}\n   ```\n\n1. Launch the operator pod:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbonomic/t8c-install/master/operator/deploy/operator.yaml -n ${NS}\n   ```\n\n1. Wait for the operator to become available (status = running with 1/1 ready). Check the status using:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc get pods -n ${NS} -w\n   ```\n\n   Example output:\n\n   ```\n   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   t8c-operator-fdd8b8c94-dhrt4   1/1     Running   0          72s\n   ```\n\n   > **Note:** Type `Ctrl-C` to exit the watch loop.\n\nNext, we are going to configure the Turbonomic instance.\n\n---\n\n## 2-4: Configure the Turbonomic Instance: Custom Resource\n\n1. Set the storage class:\n\n   ```sh\n   export STORAGE_CLASS=ibmc-block-gold\n   ```\n\n   > **Note:** The lab instructions assume you using [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started).\n   > For other OpenShift environments, use `oc get storageclass` to select a storage class that is available in your environment.\n\n1. Apply a custom resource file to launch Turbonomic:\n\n   ```sh\n   cat << EOF | oc -n ${NS} apply -f -\n   apiVersion: charts.helm.k8s.io/v1\n   kind: Xl\n   metadata:\n     name: xl-release\n     namespace: ${NS}\n   spec:\n     global:\n       customImageNames: false\n       repository: registry.connect.redhat.com/turbonomic\n       securityContext:\n         fsGroup: ${FSGROUP}\n       storageClassName: ${STORAGE_CLASS}\n       storageSelector: false\n       tag: 8.4.4\n     openshiftingress:\n       enabled: true\n     kubeturbo:\n       enabled: true\n     nginx:\n       httpsRedirect: false\n       nginxIsPrimaryIngress: false\n     nginxingress:\n       enabled: false\n     instana:\n       enabled: true\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n1. Deployment will begin for all the Turbonomic pods. Depending on the environment, this may take some time to complete, anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes.\n   Use the command below to check the status of the deployment.\n\n   ```sh\n   oc get pods -n ${NS} -w\n   ```\n\n   > **Note:** Type `Ctrl-C` to exit the watch loop.\n\n   Ensure all the pods:\n\n   - are in a `Running` state (`STATUS` column) and\n   - show `1/1` in the `READY` column.\n\n   **Example output only (Do not copy and paste into your terminal):**\n\n   ```\n   NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\n   action-orchestrator-55bbb96fd8-bxv59   1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   api-6d876bd5c8-ntpc9                   1/1     Running   0             17m\n   auth-57d95cdc4f-7x7jq                  1/1     Running   0             17m\n   clustermgr-5bff4bc746-9fvz4            1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   consul-6b979f7d9d-ncb9f                1/1     Running   0             17m\n   cost-679689bcb8-9r8h7                  1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   db-5547b8bb9c-xjlk8                    1/1     Running   0             17m\n   group-7c66b96cd6-jf69l                 1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   history-75c89bdcdb-vcsv4               1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   kafka-54b458c5ff-25tkp                 1/1     Running   0             17m\n   kubeturbo-6b7568cbd-8gdqp              1/1     Running   0             17m\n   market-784cd4f9fb-26879                1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   plan-orchestrator-5fb588cdc6-wsz4l     1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   repository-85bb8b95c4-w85nv            1/1     Running   2 (14m ago)   17m\n   rsyslog-64c7fb4467-qcj9v               1/1     Running   0             17m\n   t8c-operator-fdd8b8c94-jwwj8           1/1     Running   0             18m\n   topology-processor-77f7f95c8-lmpzr     1/1     Running   0             17m\n   ui-6d4ff8787d-6zhm4                    1/1     Running   0             17m\n   zookeeper-57658f68c6-6qdgb             1/1     Running   0             17m\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 2-5: Launch the Turbonomic User interface\n\nYou are now ready to open a browser and login to the Turbonomic user interface.\n\n1. Get the Turbonomic UI route after the deployment completes:\n\n   ```sh\n   oc get route -n ${NS} | grep api | awk '{print $2}'\n   ```\n\n1. Open the Turbonomic UI in your browser using the URL retrieved from the previous step.\n\n1. The first time you log in to Turbonomic, you will be prompted to create a password for the `administrator` user:\n\n   ![](images/firstTimeLogin.png)\n\n   - Set this to something secure and memorable.\n   - Save the password for future logins.\n   - Click on the `Create Account` button.\n\n---\n\n## 2-6: License Configuration\n\nOnce logged in, the setup wizard will prompt you to import the license key:\n\n![](images/license1.png)\n\n> **Note:**\n>\n> - If attending a scheduled Tech Jam, your lab proctors will provide you the\n>   license file.\n> - If following these instructions offline outside a scheduled Tech Jam, the\n>   license file can be found within your downloaded software archive.\n\n1.
