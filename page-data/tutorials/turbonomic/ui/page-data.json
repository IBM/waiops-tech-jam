Notice that the entities have different colors, where:\n\n   - **red** indicates performance risk, e.g. where entities need to be moved to\n     a more optimal host or scaled up because of resource congestion or\n     under-provisioning.\n   - **yellow** indicates efficiency opportunities, e.g. where resources can be\n     reclaimed due to overprovisioning, or potentially turned off / deleted.\n   - **green** indicates entities in their desired, optimal state, which is what\n     we are after. Green means no recommended actions at this time.\n\n   > **Note:** Cost is a by-product of assuring application performance.
