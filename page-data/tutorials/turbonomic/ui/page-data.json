You are invited to interactively navigate through the user\r\ninterface in your deployed instance of Turbonomic ARM as we walk through this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Screenshots may not fully align to your individual environment.\r\n> The aim of this section is to get familiar with the key UI points of\r\n> interest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3-2: Turbonomic UI\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the Turbonomic UI home page:\r\n\r\n   > **Tip:** To get back to the homepage, you can click the green **ON** icon\r\n   > in the top-left (left navigation pane):\r\n   > ![homepage icon](images/homepage-icon.png)\r\n\r\n   ![](images/turboUI-1.png)\r\n\r\n   ![](images/turboUI-2.png)\r\n\r\n1. When Turbonomic ARM is deployed and selected environments are targeted,\r\n   Turbonomic discovers all of the entities in the targeted environments. It\r\n   then builds out this graphic you see here called the **supply chain**:\r\n\r\n   ![](images/turboUI-3.png)\r\n\r\n   The **supply chain** stitches together all of the entities from the top-level\r\n   business application down through to the supporting infrastructure.\r\n\r\n1. Notice that the entities have different colors, where:\r\n\r\n   - **red** indicates performance risk, e.g. where entities need to be moved to\r\n     a more optimal host or scaled up because of resource congestion or\r\n     under-provisioning.\r\n   - **yellow** indicates efficiency opportunities, e.g. where resources can be\r\n     reclaimed due to overprovisioning, or potentially turned off / deleted.\r\n   - **green** indicates entities in their desired, optimal state, which is what\r\n     we are after. Green means no recommended actions at this time.\r\n\r\n   > **Note:** Cost is a by-product of assuring application performance. If\r\n   > actions can be safely taken for efficiency gains without impacting\r\n   > application performance and therefore user experience, Turbonomic ARM\r\n   > will recommend, and if enabled to, take the automated actions to\r\n   > proactively ensure application performance whilst making the most\r\n   > efficient use of your infrastructure, resources and cloud budget.\r\n\r\n1. Also on this home page, there are widgets for `Top Business Applications`,\r\n   `Top Business Transactions`, and `Top Services` that allow you to quickly\r\n   assess the risk to the running applications. Not only can you quickly see the\r\n   applications with the highest risk, but you can also click `Show All` to see\r\n   the complete list of Business Applications and relevant metrics:\r\n\r\n   ![](images/turboUI-4.png)\r\n\r\n1.
