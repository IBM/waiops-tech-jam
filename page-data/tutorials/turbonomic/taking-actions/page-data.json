Open your Instana dashboard. Navigate to `Platform -> Kubernetes`.\r\n   ![](images/action-1.png)\r\n\r\n1. Select your Robot Shop cluster.\r\n\r\n1. Under the `Namespaces` tab, select `robot-shop`.\r\n\r\n   ![](images/action-2.png)\r\n\r\n1. Click on the `Pods` tab and choose the `Map` view:\r\n\r\n   - Analyze the CPU Limits, CPU Requests, Memory Limits, and Memory Requests.\r\n\r\n   For example, here's what the CPU Limits look like for Robot Shop app\r\n   before taking any Turbonomic ARM recommended actions:\r\n\r\n   ![](images/action-3.png)\r\n\r\n1. Then go to the Turbonomic ARM dashboard and navigate to the `Robot Shop`\r\n   application:\r\n\r\n   ![](images/action-4.png)\r\n\r\n1. Here, we can see come key application metrics provided by Instana, e.g.\r\n   response time and transactions and how they have evolved over time.\r\n\r\n   - Turbonomic uses this data to provided actionable insights\r\n     in the form of recommended actions you could take to improve performance\r\n     and/or improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n   - You will notice either green, red or yellow segments of the circles on\r\n     `Container Cluster` section of the Business Application Tree on the left\r\n     side of the screen (the **supply chain**).\r\n\r\n   ![](images/action-5.png)\r\n\r\n1. Click that circle and it will take you to a screen like below:\r\n\r\n   - You will notice that there are `Pending Actions` that Turbonomic suggests\r\n     will improve the performance and efficiency of the application:\r\n\r\n   ![](images/action-6.png)\r\n\r\n   > **Note:** Turbonomic does not recommend actions for a Business Application,\r\n   > Transactions, or Services, but it does recommend actions for the underlying\r\n   > Application Components and infrastructure entities, thus providing\r\n   > visibility into the risks that have a direct impact on the Business\r\n   > Application's performance.\r\n\r\n1.
