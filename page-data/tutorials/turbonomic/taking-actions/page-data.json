Click on the `Pods` tab and choose the `Map` view:\n\n   - Analyze the CPU Limits, CPU Requests, Memory Limits, and Memory Requests.\n\n   For example, here's what the CPU Limits look like for Robot Shop app\n   before taking any Turbonomic ARM recommended actions:\n\n   ![](images/action-3.png)\n\n1. Then go to the Turbonomic ARM dashboard and navigate to the `Robot Shop`\n   application:\n\n   ![](images/action-4.png)\n\n1. Here, we can see come key application metrics provided by Instana, e.g.\n   response time and transactions and how they have evolved over time.\n\n   - Turbonomic uses this data to provided actionable insights\n     in the form of recommended actions you could take to improve performance\n     and/or improve efficiency.\n\n   - You will notice either green, red or yellow segments of the circles on\n     `Container Cluster` section of the Business Application Tree on the left\n     side of the screen (the **supply chain**).\n\n   ![](images/action-5.png)\n\n1.
