In the Instana console:\n\n   - navigate to `Settings -> Team Settings page -> API Tokens`.\n   - Click on `Add API Token` to create an API key from Instana.\n\n   ![](images/addApiToken.png)\n\n1. In the create API token page, enter a name for your token, e.g.\n   `Turbonomic API Token`:\n\n   > **Important:** Copy the API token generated use in later steps:\n   >\n   > 1. Click the _eye_ icon as in screen shot below. This will show the token.\n   > 2. Click the _copy_ icon next to the token to actually copy the token:\n   >    - Clicking the _eye_ icon alone does not copy the generated token,\n   >      it just makes it visible.\n\n   ![](images/apiToken1.png)\n\n1. Then scroll down to the `Permissions` section to enable the following\n   permissions:\n\n   - Access to audit log\n   - Access to token and session timeout settings\n   - Access to license usage\n   - Access to on prem license usage\n   - Access to account and billing information\n   - Service & endpoint mapping\n\n   ![](images/apiToken2.png)\n\n1. Click on the `Save` button. The API token is created.\n\n   ![](images/apiToken3.png)\n\n1. In the Turbonomic console, go to `Settings -> Target Configuration`:\n\n   ![](images/targetConfiguration.png)\n\n1. Click on the `NEW TARGET` button (top-right) and then select\n   `Applications and Databases`:\n\n   ![](images/applicationAndDatabases.png)\n\n1. Click on `Instana`:\n\n   ![](images/instanaTarget.png)\n\n1. Add the Instana hostname, API key (which you have created in Step 2 earlier),\n   and proxy username set as `administrator`:\n\n   > **Note:** For _Instana hostname_ use the Instana server's IP address if\n   > using a provisioned lab environment during a scheduled Tech Jam event.\n   >\n   > Normally, if your Instana server has a DNS resolvable name, you can use\n   > that.\n\n   ![](images/addInstanaTarget.png)\n\n   > **Note:** It can take some time for Turbonomic to discover and validate the\n   > target.
