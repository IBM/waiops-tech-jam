Working with Metric Manager will help you understand fundamentals of data mediation, and allow you to support customers who are currently using it. It is, in general, recommended to go with Watson AIOps for greenfield customers, but there may be certain POCs where it may make more sense to use Metric Manager to do your anomaly analysis due to off-the-shelf integrations and the ability to more easily search and display historical anomalies.\n\nThe labs will start out with kicking off an installation of Watson AIOps AI Manager to support lab 7, then go through installation of the VM-based Metric Manager including installation of the latest fix pack. Then you will learn how to model and mediate data that resides in CSV files. You will learn how to access the results of the analysis and machine learning. You will then learn how to mediate data using the REST interface available in both VM-based Metric Manager, and Watson AIOps Metric Anomaly Detection (MAD). Finally, you will explore the new capabilities of Watson AIOps Metric Anomaly Detection.\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9e25cebdb6a3420d35b3b01aa8cd14ed","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1052},"frontmatter":{"title":"Metric Manager and Metric Anomaly Detection","description":"Metric Manager and Metric Anomaly Detection"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Metric Manager and Metric Anomaly Detection \ndescription: Metric Manager and Metric Anomaly Detection\n---\n\nIn these set of labs, we will be working with both the on-prem deployment of Metric Manager (formerly known as Predictive Insights), and the emerging Metric Anomaly Detection (MAD) component that is part of the CloudPak for Watson AIOps AI Manager installation.
