If you don't already have VNC installed, you can download the RealVNC VNC Viewer for your operating system at the following link:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/\" target=\"_blank\">RealVNC Downloads</a>\n\nMacOS, Window, and Linux clients are avaialable.\n\nFor the execution of the labs, you will need the following passwords, provided to you by your lab proctor at the beginning of the session: <br/>\n\n**<span style=\"color:green\"><VNC PASSWORD\\></span>**  <br/>\n**<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  <br/> \n**<span style=\"color:green\"><DEFAULT CASSANDRA PASSWORD\\></span>** <br/>\n**<span style=\"color:green\"><CASSANDRA PASSWORD\\></span>**\n\n\n## 3-2: Accessing your Metric Manager lab environment\n\n  Open your VNC Viewer and create a new connection (File -> New Connection)\n\n  Use your lab machine's IP address (the 'pi-template' ip address you used yesterday for the probe lab), and display #3 as shown in the example below (e.g. <IPADDR\\>:3 - your lab machine's IP address will differ). Leave everything else default. Click OK when complete.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture1.png)\n\n  Double-click on your new connection in the main VNC Viewer interface. You will be presented with a window asking you for the password. Use <span style=\"color:green\">**<VNC PASSWORD\\>**</span>.\n\n  You may next be presented with another login screen asking you to login as the 'scadmin' user to the desktop. If it asks, use the scadmin user password: **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**.\n\n  You will be logged into the desktop for the 'scadmin' user. Next, right-click in the desktop background and select **Open Terminal** to open a terminal session.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture2.png)\n\n  You are now prepared to proceed with the installation of Metric Manager.\n\n## 3-3: Installing IBM Streams\n  Metric Manager uses IBM Streams as its core ingestion/analytics engine. As such, the Streams software must be installed prior to installing the Metric Manager. The Streams install is very straightforward and only takes a couple of minutes.\n\n\n  From your terminal command line, run the following command to start the Streams install:\n\n```sh\n./PI-Installables/CNH5LEN/StreamsInstallFiles/IBMStreamsSetup.bin\n```\n\n  Select your preferred language, and click \"OK\". Next, ensure you select the IBM Streams install:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture3.png)\n\n  Click through the Introduction screen, and accept the licenes agreement. When you come to the installation directory screen, change the installation path from the scadmin home directory to \" **/opt/IBM/InfoSphere\\_Streams**\":\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture4.png)\n\nClick **Next**, review the install summary, and if everything looks ok, select **Install**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-addon1.png)\n\n When install is complete, **uncheck the \"Open Domain Manager\"** and click next, then \"done\" to complete the install.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture5.png)\n\n\n  Next, you will need to add some entries into the scadmin user's .bashrc file to ensure that the Predictive Insights software knows where Streams is installed and uses the proper version of java. To do this, add the following lines to the scadmin user's .bashrc file using your text editor of choice. Both vi and nano are installed on the system, or you can use the GUI version of the text editor by running:\n\n```sh\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nPlace these lines at the bottom of the .bashrc file, save the file, then exit\n\n```sh\nif [ -f /opt/IBM/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.3/bin/streamsprofile.sh ]; then\n . /opt/IBM/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.3/bin/streamsprofile.sh\nfi\n\nPATH=/opt/IBM/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.3/java/bin:$PATH\n\nJAVA_HOME=/opt/IBM/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.3/java\n\nexport PATH JAVA_HOME\n```\n\n**Alternatively, you can run the following command to append these lines to the scadmin user's .bashrc file. Be careful here and make a backup incase you accidentally overwrite the file instead of append:**\n\n```sh\ncp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc-BAK\ncat /home/scadmin/PI-Installables/bashrc >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n Once you have modified the scadmin user's .bashrc, re-source the new .bashrc by issuing the following command (or close/re-open the terminal window). You should receive a confirmation message indicating that the streams environment has been set up:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nYou should receive the following message indicating that the environment has been set up:\n\n `IBM Streams environment variables have been set.`\n\n## 3-4: Installing Metric Manager (Predictive Insights)\n\n  To install Metric Manager, DB2 needs to be running. From the command line window, issue the following command to start DB2:\n\n```sh\ndb2start\n```\n\n  Next, issue the following command to start the installation manager:\n\n```sh\n/home/scadmin/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/launcher\n```\n\n  The main IBM Installation Manager screen is presented:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture6.png)\n\n  You must first add the Predictive Insights installation files to the Installation manager repositories. To do that, click on the **File-\\>Preferences** menu item in the Installation Manager UI, and select \"Add Repositories\":\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture7.png)\n\n\n  Click the \"Browse\" button, and navigate to \"Home-\\>PI-Installables-\\>predictiveInsightsInstaller1.3.6-\\>offeringâ€¦. Select \"repository.config\" and click \"OK\", and \"OK\" again to add the repository to Installation Manager.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture8.png)\n\n\n  Your repositories list should look like this, and you can click **Ok** to go back to the main menu and continue to install:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture9.png)\n\n  From the main menu, click **Install** and select Predictive Insights as illustrated, then click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture10.png)\n\n\n  Accept the license agreement and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture11.png)\n\n\n  Leave the defaults for creating the package group and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture12.png)\n\n\n  The Metric Manager is a distributed application, and various components can be installed on separate servers. For our purposes, however, we will be installing all components of MM/PI, so leave everything checked as default and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture13.png)\n\n\n  The next screen is DB2 configuration. Since DB2 is installed and running locally, you can leave most as defaults, but change the password to **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**. Click the **Validate** button. The installer will login to the DB2 instance to verify that the credentials are proper. If the verify fails, double-check that you typed the proper password.\n\n When the validation succeeds you will be able to click on the **Next \\>** button to move to the next section, as shown below:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture14.png)\n\n\n  The next screen is the Analytics configuration. This allows you to define a starting PI topic. Modify the **Topic Name** box to add **TEST** as a topic and click **Validate**. When Validation succeeds, click **Next**:\n\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture15.png)\n\n  Next, you will be presented with the configuration for OMNIbus integration. This ensures that any anomaly alerts are sent to the OMNIbus event processor. For this lab, we will be integrating with an existing OMNIbus that is running on the local server. As such, **leaving these options as default** and selecting **Validate** should succeed so you can continue to the next installation panel:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture16.png)\n\n_NOTE: If you get an error indicating that port 4100 is not reachable, open up a separate window and start up the following services, using **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** as the authentication password:_\n\n```sh\nsystemctl start nco\nsystemctl start netcoolwebgui\n```\n\nAnd click **Validate** again. If you continue to have issues, consult a lab proctor.\n\n_Note: it is possible to integrate the on-prem version of MM with NOI/Watson AIOps Event Manager running on OCP. Contact Jason Cress / [jcress@us.ibm.com](mailto:jcress@us.ibm.com) for instructions on how this integration is achieved._\n\n  The next screen, \"UI Configuration\", will require the following changes:\n\nusername and password that installed dash: **scadmin** / **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \nEnter DASH install dir : **/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM**  \nEnter DASH profile dir : **/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM/profile/**  \nEnter DASH Profile user/password : **piadmin** / **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \n\n Leave the rest of the entries as default.\n\n Once you have edited the proper variables, click **Validate**. A little patience is required on this step - validation will take some time to complete, as it does several things to verify that it can log into the DASH profile as an admin, extract keys, etc. If the validation fails, verify your entries and try again.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture17.png)\n\n\n  Once validation succeeds, click Next and you will be presented with the configuration panel for WebGUI. Some critical changes need to be made:\n\n Change the \"Enter WebGUI Install dir\" to: **/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/gui/omnibus\\_webgui**\n\n Enter the WebGUI user password for the ncoadmin user: **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**\n\n Leave everything else as default, including leaving the OMNIbus password blank.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture18.png)\n\n Click **Validate** and you should be able to click **Next** after validation. If validation fails, double check the install directory (/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/**gui**/omnibus\\_webgui), the user (ncoadmin), and the password (**<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**) and try again.\n\n  The next installation screen shows the local MM UI configuration screen. Leave these as default and click **Validate**. When the validation succeeds, click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture19.png)\n\n\n  Next, the installation screen will show the Mediation Tool options. You may leave these as they are and click **Validate**. Once validation completes, click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture20.png)\n\n  Finally, you will be presented with the install screen. Click **Install** to perform the installation:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture21.png)\n\n  Take a break. After about 7 to 10 minutes you should be presented with the following screen indicating that the installation was successful:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture22.png)\n\n _Note: if you see an orange icon with a message indicating the install completed with warnings, please continue the labs. We will be rebuilding the topic after the install of ifix5_\n\n Click **Finish** to, and then select **File -\\> Exit** to exit the installer and return to your terminal.\n\n The installation makes updates to the environment variables in the scadmin user's .bashrc file, so you \\*MUST\\* re-source the new bashrc as such:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n Delete the TEST topic that we created during the installation:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/analytics/bin/admin.sh delete_topic TEST\n```\n\n You have completed the installation of Metric Manager. In the next section, you will install the latest update.\n\n## 3-5: Installing Metric Manager Interim Fix 5 \n\nThe latest fix pack for Metric Manager is always available on the IBM Fix Central site. As of this writing, the latest available fix is IFIX5. It provides fixes for the core analytics, the UI, and installs a new version of Streams. Finally, it provides an update to the REST/Kafka mediation components, which we will work with in an upcoming lab.\n\n To install the latest IFIX, you will run the updates from the command line using the following steps:\n\n\n Open up a terminal and change your working directory to the directory **/opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6\\_iFix5\\_el7\\_x86\\_64:**\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64\n```\n\n Run the update script to patch the core analytics components:\n\n```sh\n./patch_PI_core_analytics_136_iFix5.sh\n```\n\n You will be prompted to enter the passwords for the DB2 database and the OMNIbus root user. Use the following:\n\n DB2 database password: **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \n OMNIbus root user is blank, so just hit **enter**\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture24.png)\n\n Accept the license agreement, and the Streams portion of the update will proceed.\n\n When the Streams update completes, you will be prompted to display and accept the license agreement. Enter \"S\" to skip the license display, and enter \"Y\" to accept the license.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture23.png)\n\n You will once more be prompted to enter the OMNIbus root user password. Just hit **Enter** again.\n\n  The installation will complete. Next, you will need to restart the VNC daemon and re-open your VNC session. To perform this action, restart the VNC service using the following command, and authenticating with as the authentication **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** password.\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart vncserver@:3\n```\n\n After a minute or two, your VNC session should reconnect to the scadmin user's desktop. If it doesn't automatically reconnect, close the VNC session window and reconnect from the VNC Viewer connections list.\n\n\n  Next, we will test to make sure that the update installed properly.\n\n Open a terminal, and change your working directory to the analytics binary directory, and run the admin.sh command to show the version:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/scanalytics/analytics/bin\n./admin.sh show_version\n```\n\nIf the update was installed successfully, you should see the following result:\n\n**VERSION\n 1.3.6.5\\_20211124**\n\n Additionally, we will test the software to ensure the database connection is still good. Run the following command to verify:\n\n```sh\n./admin.sh create_topic TEST\n```\n\nIf there are any errors, particularly with regards to database connectivity, try re-sourcing your .bashrc:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAnd try to create your topic again. If the issue persists, consult the lab proctor.\n\n\n  Now that the core analytics components have been successfully updated, you will next install the IFIX5 User Interface (UI) update. From your terminal window, change your working directory to:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64\n```\n\nAnd run the update UI script:\n\n```sh\n./patch_PI_UI_136_iFix5.sh\n```\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n# ** !!! DANGER, WILL ROBINSON !!! **\n\nThe next portion of the installation will prompt you for 14 values. You must be *deliberate* in entering these values, and you must enter them as shown below. The interim fix installation script does not verify the values you enter here, and even though the prompts suggest default values, the defaults will not be accepted. **Please ensure that you enter the correct values as listed below!**\n\n JazzSM/WebGUI host: ```pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud```  \n JazzSM base directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM```  \n JazzSM profile directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM/profile```  \n permission to start JazzSM: ```Y```  \n JazzSM/WAS server: ```server1```  \n WebGUI base directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/gui/omnibus_webgui```  \n JazzSM/WebGUI non-secure port: ```16310```  \n JazzSM/WebGUI secure port: ```16311```  \n WebGUI Admin username: ```ncoadmin```  \n ncoadmin's password: ```<LAB PASSWORD>```  \n Predictive Insights UI host: ```pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud```  \n Predictive Insights UI base folder: ```/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI```  \n Predictive Insights installer folder: ```/opt/IBM/scanalytics/install_scadmin```  \n Predictive Insights UI non-secure port: ```9999```   \n\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture26.png)\n\nOnce all information is entered, you will be prompted for the type of upgrade you want to perform. Select \"1\" to perform a full UI upgrade:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture27.png)\n\n The script will update the UI components and will complete in a few minutes. Once it is complete, use the following command to ensure the UI is up and running:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI/bin/pi.sh -status\n```\n\nThe output should indicate that the UI is up and running.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture28.png)\n\n\nIf it shows down, wait a minute, and try the status command again. If it still shows down after a couple of minutes, perform a manual restart of the UI by running:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI/bin/pi.sh -start\n```\n\n  Next, we will verify that the UI is accessible from the web browser. From the desktop, click on the Red Hat application menu and select \"Firefox\" from the drop-down menu:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture29.png)\n\n\n  You should be presented with the IBM Dashboard Application Services Hub login window. Login as \"ncoadmin\" with a password of **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**.\n\n After logging in, you'll be presented with an \"Information\" window indicating that Predictive Insights is using a self-signed certificate. **!! DO NOT CLICK CLOSE !!**\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture30.png)\n\n Click on the link \"Predictive Insights (pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud)\"\n\n In the pop-up window, click \"Advanced\", and click \"Accept the Risk and Continue\". This will allow you to access the PI UI despite having a self-signed certificate.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture31.png)\n\n Next, click on the \"Snowflake\" icon in the left navigation pane, and select \"Service Diagnosis Metric Search\":\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture32.png)\n\n\n You should be presented with the following window:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture33.png)\n\n If you receive an error, consult your lab proctor.\n\n\n## 3-6: Installing the REST Mediation Service\n\nNow that both the Core and UI components of Metric Manager are updated, our last step for install is to install the REST mediation service. Close firefox, return to your terminal, and follow these steps to install:\n\n\n  Change your working directory to the IFIX extracted directory\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64/REST_Mediation_utility\n```\n\n  Extract Cassandra and move the directory to /opt/IBM:\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf apache-cassandra-3.11.10-bin.tar.gz\nmv apache-cassandra-3.11.10 /opt/IBM/\n```\n\n\n  Extract kafka, move the directory to /opt/IBM, and change ownership to 'piadmin' (sudo password is **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**):\n\n```sh\ntar -xvzf kafka_2.13-2.6.2.tgz\nmv kafka_2.13-2.6.2 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/kafka_2.13-2.6.2\n```\n\n  Extract spark, move the directory to /opt/IBM, and change ownership to 'piadmin':\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz\nmv spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2\n```\n\n  Copy the PI mediation directory to /opt/IBM, and change its ownership to piadmin:\n\n```sh\ncp -R pi-mediation-1.0.4 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/pi-mediation-1.0.4\n```\n\n\n  The latest REST mediation service requires a later version of Python. Unzip the Python package and build/compile it. Use **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** if prompted for the sudo password:\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf Python-2.7.18.tgz\ncd Python-2.7.18\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nOnce the build completes, restart the VNC service:\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart vncserver@:3\n```\n\n After a moment or two, your VNC session should reconnect to a blank desktop. If it doesn't automatically reconnect after a minute or two, close the VNC session window and reconnect from the VNC Viewer connections list.\n\n Once you are back into your VNC session, open a terminal and verify that the Python version on the system has been updated by running:\n\n```sh\npython --version\n```\n\nIt should return with \"Python 2.7.18\"\n\nInstallation and update of the Metric Manager components is now complete! Proceed to the next lab to learn how to model and ingest CSV data.\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"78fa78318b6fc6945fa5423bf84fd6de","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":888},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Metric Manager","description":"How to install Metric Manager"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Installing Metric Manager\ndescription: How to install Metric Manager\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>3-1: Lab Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3-2: Accessing your Metric Manager lab environment</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3-3: Installing IBM Streams</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3-4: Installing Metric Manager (Predictive Insights)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3-5: Installing Metric Manager Interim Fix 5</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3-6: Installing the REST Mediation Service</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## 3-1: Lab Introduction \n\nIn this lab, you will be installing the various components that make up the VM-based Metric Manager (formerly Predictive Insights) solution, as well as installing the latest Interim Fix (IFIX5), and the REST Mediation Service, which will be used in an upcoming lab.\n\nYou will need to use VNC to access the UI of your VM.

Select \"repository.config\" and click \"OK\", and \"OK\" again to add the repository to Installation Manager.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture8.png)\n\n\n  Your repositories list should look like this, and you can click **Ok** to go back to the main menu and continue to install:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture9.png)\n\n  From the main menu, click **Install** and select Predictive Insights as illustrated, then click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture10.png)\n\n\n  Accept the license agreement and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture11.png)\n\n\n  Leave the defaults for creating the package group and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture12.png)\n\n\n  The Metric Manager is a distributed application, and various components can be installed on separate servers. For our purposes, however, we will be installing all components of MM/PI, so leave everything checked as default and click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture13.png)\n\n\n  The next screen is DB2 configuration. Since DB2 is installed and running locally, you can leave most as defaults, but change the password to **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**. Click the **Validate** button. The installer will login to the DB2 instance to verify that the credentials are proper. If the verify fails, double-check that you typed the proper password.\n\n When the validation succeeds you will be able to click on the **Next \\>** button to move to the next section, as shown below:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture14.png)\n\n\n  The next screen is the Analytics configuration. This allows you to define a starting PI topic. Modify the **Topic Name** box to add **TEST** as a topic and click **Validate**. When Validation succeeds, click **Next**:\n\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture15.png)\n\n  Next, you will be presented with the configuration for OMNIbus integration. This ensures that any anomaly alerts are sent to the OMNIbus event processor. For this lab, we will be integrating with an existing OMNIbus that is running on the local server. As such, **leaving these options as default** and selecting **Validate** should succeed so you can continue to the next installation panel:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture16.png)\n\n_NOTE: If you get an error indicating that port 4100 is not reachable, open up a separate window and start up the following services, using **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** as the authentication password:_\n\n```sh\nsystemctl start nco\nsystemctl start netcoolwebgui\n```\n\nAnd click **Validate** again. If you continue to have issues, consult a lab proctor.\n\n_Note: it is possible to integrate the on-prem version of MM with NOI/Watson AIOps Event Manager running on OCP. Contact Jason Cress / [jcress@us.ibm.com](mailto:jcress@us.ibm.com) for instructions on how this integration is achieved._\n\n  The next screen, \"UI Configuration\", will require the following changes:\n\nusername and password that installed dash: **scadmin** / **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \nEnter DASH install dir : **/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM**  \nEnter DASH profile dir : **/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM/profile/**  \nEnter DASH Profile user/password : **piadmin** / **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \n\n Leave the rest of the entries as default.\n\n Once you have edited the proper variables, click **Validate**. A little patience is required on this step - validation will take some time to complete, as it does several things to verify that it can log into the DASH profile as an admin, extract keys, etc. If the validation fails, verify your entries and try again.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture17.png)\n\n\n  Once validation succeeds, click Next and you will be presented with the configuration panel for WebGUI. Some critical changes need to be made:\n\n Change the \"Enter WebGUI Install dir\" to: **/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/gui/omnibus\\_webgui**\n\n Enter the WebGUI user password for the ncoadmin user: **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**\n\n Leave everything else as default, including leaving the OMNIbus password blank.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture18.png)\n\n Click **Validate** and you should be able to click **Next** after validation. If validation fails, double check the install directory (/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/**gui**/omnibus\\_webgui), the user (ncoadmin), and the password (**<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**) and try again.\n\n  The next installation screen shows the local MM UI configuration screen. Leave these as default and click **Validate**. When the validation succeeds, click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture19.png)\n\n\n  Next, the installation screen will show the Mediation Tool options. You may leave these as they are and click **Validate**. Once validation completes, click **Next**:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture20.png)\n\n  Finally, you will be presented with the install screen. Click **Install** to perform the installation:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture21.png)\n\n  Take a break. After about 7 to 10 minutes you should be presented with the following screen indicating that the installation was successful:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture22.png)\n\n _Note: if you see an orange icon with a message indicating the install completed with warnings, please continue the labs. We will be rebuilding the topic after the install of ifix5_\n\n Click **Finish** to, and then select **File -\\> Exit** to exit the installer and return to your terminal.\n\n The installation makes updates to the environment variables in the scadmin user's .bashrc file, so you \\*MUST\\* re-source the new bashrc as such:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n Delete the TEST topic that we created during the installation:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/analytics/bin/admin.sh delete_topic TEST\n```\n\n You have completed the installation of Metric Manager. In the next section, you will install the latest update.\n\n## 3-5: Installing Metric Manager Interim Fix 5 \n\nThe latest fix pack for Metric Manager is always available on the IBM Fix Central site. As of this writing, the latest available fix is IFIX5. It provides fixes for the core analytics, the UI, and installs a new version of Streams. Finally, it provides an update to the REST/Kafka mediation components, which we will work with in an upcoming lab.\n\n To install the latest IFIX, you will run the updates from the command line using the following steps:\n\n\n Open up a terminal and change your working directory to the directory **/opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6\\_iFix5\\_el7\\_x86\\_64:**\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64\n```\n\n Run the update script to patch the core analytics components:\n\n```sh\n./patch_PI_core_analytics_136_iFix5.sh\n```\n\n You will be prompted to enter the passwords for the DB2 database and the OMNIbus root user. Use the following:\n\n DB2 database password: **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**  \n OMNIbus root user is blank, so just hit **enter**\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture24.png)\n\n Accept the license agreement, and the Streams portion of the update will proceed.\n\n When the Streams update completes, you will be prompted to display and accept the license agreement. Enter \"S\" to skip the license display, and enter \"Y\" to accept the license.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture23.png)\n\n You will once more be prompted to enter the OMNIbus root user password. Just hit **Enter** again.\n\n  The installation will complete. Next, you will need to restart the VNC daemon and re-open your VNC session. To perform this action, restart the VNC service using the following command, and authenticating with as the authentication **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** password.\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart vncserver@:3\n```\n\n After a minute or two, your VNC session should reconnect to the scadmin user's desktop. If it doesn't automatically reconnect, close the VNC session window and reconnect from the VNC Viewer connections list.\n\n\n  Next, we will test to make sure that the update installed properly.\n\n Open a terminal, and change your working directory to the analytics binary directory, and run the admin.sh command to show the version:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/scanalytics/analytics/bin\n./admin.sh show_version\n```\n\nIf the update was installed successfully, you should see the following result:\n\n**VERSION\n 1.3.6.5\\_20211124**\n\n Additionally, we will test the software to ensure the database connection is still good. Run the following command to verify:\n\n```sh\n./admin.sh create_topic TEST\n```\n\nIf there are any errors, particularly with regards to database connectivity, try re-sourcing your .bashrc:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAnd try to create your topic again. If the issue persists, consult the lab proctor.\n\n\n  Now that the core analytics components have been successfully updated, you will next install the IFIX5 User Interface (UI) update. From your terminal window, change your working directory to:\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64\n```\n\nAnd run the update UI script:\n\n```sh\n./patch_PI_UI_136_iFix5.sh\n```\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n# ** !!! DANGER, WILL ROBINSON !!! **\n\nThe next portion of the installation will prompt you for 14 values. You must be *deliberate* in entering these values, and you must enter them as shown below. The interim fix installation script does not verify the values you enter here, and even though the prompts suggest default values, the defaults will not be accepted. **Please ensure that you enter the correct values as listed below!**\n\n JazzSM/WebGUI host: ```pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud```  \n JazzSM base directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM```  \n JazzSM profile directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/JazzSM/profile```  \n permission to start JazzSM: ```Y```  \n JazzSM/WAS server: ```server1```  \n WebGUI base directory: ```/home/scadmin/IBM/netcool/gui/omnibus_webgui```  \n JazzSM/WebGUI non-secure port: ```16310```  \n JazzSM/WebGUI secure port: ```16311```  \n WebGUI Admin username: ```ncoadmin```  \n ncoadmin's password: ```<LAB PASSWORD>```  \n Predictive Insights UI host: ```pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud```  \n Predictive Insights UI base folder: ```/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI```  \n Predictive Insights installer folder: ```/opt/IBM/scanalytics/install_scadmin```  \n Predictive Insights UI non-secure port: ```9999```   \n\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture26.png)\n\nOnce all information is entered, you will be prompted for the type of upgrade you want to perform. Select \"1\" to perform a full UI upgrade:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture27.png)\n\n The script will update the UI components and will complete in a few minutes. Once it is complete, use the following command to ensure the UI is up and running:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI/bin/pi.sh -status\n```\n\nThe output should indicate that the UI is up and running.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture28.png)\n\n\nIf it shows down, wait a minute, and try the status command again. If it still shows down after a couple of minutes, perform a manual restart of the UI by running:\n\n```sh\n/opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI/bin/pi.sh -start\n```\n\n  Next, we will verify that the UI is accessible from the web browser. From the desktop, click on the Red Hat application menu and select \"Firefox\" from the drop-down menu:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture29.png)\n\n\n  You should be presented with the IBM Dashboard Application Services Hub login window. Login as \"ncoadmin\" with a password of **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**.\n\n After logging in, you'll be presented with an \"Information\" window indicating that Predictive Insights is using a self-signed certificate. **!! DO NOT CLICK CLOSE !!**\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture30.png)\n\n Click on the link \"Predictive Insights (pi-template.Hybrid-Squad.cloud)\"\n\n In the pop-up window, click \"Advanced\", and click \"Accept the Risk and Continue\". This will allow you to access the PI UI despite having a self-signed certificate.\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture31.png)\n\n Next, click on the \"Snowflake\" icon in the left navigation pane, and select \"Service Diagnosis Metric Search\":\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture32.png)\n\n\n You should be presented with the following window:\n\n ![](images/lab2-Picture33.png)\n\n If you receive an error, consult your lab proctor.\n\n\n## 3-6: Installing the REST Mediation Service\n\nNow that both the Core and UI components of Metric Manager are updated, our last step for install is to install the REST mediation service. Close firefox, return to your terminal, and follow these steps to install:\n\n\n  Change your working directory to the IFIX extracted directory\n\n```sh\ncd /opt/IBM/software/predictiveInsights1.3.6_iFix5_el7_x86_64/REST_Mediation_utility\n```\n\n  Extract Cassandra and move the directory to /opt/IBM:\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf apache-cassandra-3.11.10-bin.tar.gz\nmv apache-cassandra-3.11.10 /opt/IBM/\n```\n\n\n  Extract kafka, move the directory to /opt/IBM, and change ownership to 'piadmin' (sudo password is **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>**):\n\n```sh\ntar -xvzf kafka_2.13-2.6.2.tgz\nmv kafka_2.13-2.6.2 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/kafka_2.13-2.6.2\n```\n\n  Extract spark, move the directory to /opt/IBM, and change ownership to 'piadmin':\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz\nmv spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2\n```\n\n  Copy the PI mediation directory to /opt/IBM, and change its ownership to piadmin:\n\n```sh\ncp -R pi-mediation-1.0.4 /opt/IBM\nsudo chown -R piadmin:piadmin /opt/IBM/pi-mediation-1.0.4\n```\n\n\n  The latest REST mediation service requires a later version of Python. Unzip the Python package and build/compile it. Use **<span style=\"color:green\"><LAB PASSWORD\\></span>** if prompted for the sudo password:\n\n```sh\ntar -xzf Python-2.7.18.tgz\ncd Python-2.7.18\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nOnce the build completes, restart the VNC service:\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl restart vncserver@:3\n```\n\n After a moment or two, your VNC session should reconnect to a blank desktop. If it doesn't automatically reconnect after a minute or two, close the VNC session window and reconnect from the VNC Viewer connections list.\n\n Once you are back into your VNC session, open a terminal and verify that the Python version on the system has been updated by running:\n\n```sh\npython --version\n```\n\nIt should return with \"Python 2.7.18\"\n\nInstallation and update of the Metric Manager components is now complete! Proceed to the next lab to learn how to model and ingest CSV data.\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Volumes/SSD Storage/IBM-DEVELOPMENT/TECHJAM2022/IBM/waiops-tech-jam/src/pages/tutorials/mm/mm-install/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
