First, login to the following link and copy your entitlement key:\n\n[https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)\n\nChange your project to 'cp4waiops':\n\n```sh\noc project cp4waiops\n```\n\nNext, issue the following command to create the secret:\n\n```sh\n oc create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key --docker-username=cp --docker-password=\\<your entitlement key\\> --docker-server=cp.icr.io --namespace=cp4waiops\n```\n\n## 1-3: Install the Watson AIOps AI Manager Operator\n\n Navigate to \"Operator Hub\", and change the project at the top of the page to your 'cp4waiops' project. Then, in the search box under \"All Items\", type in \"ai manager\":\n\n ![](images/Picture4.png)\n\n Click on the \"IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps AI Manager\" tile:\n\n ![](images/Picture5.png)\n\n Next, double-check that the \"Project\" you are in is 'cp4waiops', and click the \"Install\" button:\n\n ![](images/Picture6.png)\n\n In the next screen, you will leave the version at 3.4, but change the Installation mode to \"A specific namespace on the cluster\". Verify that the Installed Namespace says cp4waiops. If not, using the drop down box select 'cp4waiops'. Then click \"Install\".\n\n When the operator installation is complete, select \"View Operator\":\n\n ![](images/Picture7.png)\n\n\n## 1-4: Install an instance of AI Manager\n\n Now that the operator is installed, you can create instances of the AI Manager. From the Operator view, click on the \"Create instance\" Link in the AI Manager tile:\n\n ![](images/Picture8.png)\n\n You will be in the \"Create Installation\" configuration window. In this window, you will edit 4 entries:\n\n Accept the license:\n\n ![](images/Picture9.png)\n\n\n Set File Storage Class to 'ibmc-file-gold-gid'\n\n ![](images/Picture10.png)\n\n\n Set Large Block Storage Class to 'ibmc-block-gold'\n\n ![](images/Picture11.png)\n\n\n Image Pull Secret set to 'ibm-entitlement-key':\n\n ![](images/Picture12.png)\n\nSet the size to \"Small\"\n\n ![](images/Picture13.png)\n\n\n When all of the options are configured, select the 'create' button.\n\n Next, You will be brought back to the installations view, where you will see a new entry called 'ibm-cp-watson-aiops' and will be able to watch the status as the creation of your new instance proceeds. After about 5-7 minutes, it should complete and you should see the \"Phase\" change to \"Running\":\n\n ![](images/Picture14.png)\n\nThe install will take around 90 minutes, and will be ready for you when you come to Lab 6 - working with Metric Anomaly Detection in Watson AIOps.\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b6c3a73673a2e4f4370b9fed2ff6ac60","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":894},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Watson AIOps AI Manager","description":"How to install a small deployment of AI Manager"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Installing Watson AIOps AI Manager\ndescription: How to install a small deployment of AI Manager\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>1-2: Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>1-2: Create a namespace for the Watson AIOps AI Manager install</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>1-3: Install the Watson AIOps AI Manager Operator</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>1-4: Install an instance of AI Manager</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## 1-1: Introduction\n\n\nBefore we begin with Metric Manager, we will start the installation of AI Manager, as this can take 90 minutes or so to complete.\n\nIf you missed yesterday's Event Manager labs, you will need to log in to your cluster and follow step 3 of Lab 2 to create the catalog source: \n\nhttps://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/04/01/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-17\n\nIf your cluster already has the catalog source installed, you may proceed.\n\n\n\n## 1-2: Create a namespace for the Watson AIOps AI Manager install\n\n In the OpenShift UI, navigate to Projects:\n\n ![](images/Picture1.png)\n\n Then, in the upper-right corner click \"Create Project\":\n\n ![](images/Picture2.png)\n\n Call your project \"cp4waiops\":\n\n ![](images/Picture3.png)\n\nOnce your project is created, you will need to go to the command line of your control node and change the project to 'cp4waiops', then create an entitlement secret so the images for the AI Manager can be pulled.
