In these labs, we will be working with both the on-prem deployment of Metric Manager (formerly known as Predictive Insights), and the emerging Metric Anomaly Detection (MAD) component that is part of the CloudPak for Watson AIOps AI Manager installation. Working with Metric Manager will help you understand fundamentals of data mediation, and allow you to support customers who are currently using it. It is, in general, recommended to go with Watson AIOps for greenfield customers, but there may be certain POCs where it may make more sense to use Metric Manager to do your anomaly analysis due to off-the-shelf integrations and the ability to easily search and display historical anomalies.

Before we begin with Metric Manager, we will start the installation of AI Manager, as this can take 90 minutes or so to complete.

If you missed yesterday's Event Manager labs, you will need to log in to your cluster and follow step 3 of Lab 2 to create the catalog source: 

https://community.ibm.com/community/user/aiops/blogs/zane-bray1/2022/04/01/getting-started-with-watson-aiops-event-manager-17

If your cluster already has the catalog source installed, you may proceed.



## 1-1: Create a namespace for the Watson AIOps AI Manager install

 In the OpenShift UI, navigate to Projects:

 Then, in the upper-right corner click "Create Project":

 Call your project "cp4waiops":

Once your project is created, you will need to go to the command line of your control node and change the project to 'cp4waiops', then create an entitlement secret so the images for the AI Manager can be pulled. First, login to the following link and copy your entitlement key:

[https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)

Change your project to 'cp4waiops':

```sh
oc project cp4waiops
```

Next, issue the following command to create the secret:

```sh
 oc create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key --docker-username=cp --docker-password=\<your entitlement key\> --docker-server=cp.icr.io --namespace=cp4waiops
```

## 1-2: Install the Watson AIOps AI Manager Operator

 Navigate to "Operator Hub", and change the project at the top of the page to your 'cp4waiops' project. Then, in the search box under "All Items", type in "ai manager":

 Click on the "IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps AI Manager" tile:

 Next, double-check that the "Project" you are in is 'cp4waiops', and click the "Install" button:

 In the next screen, you will leave the version at 3.4, but change the Installation mode to "A specific namespace on the cluster". Verify that the Installed Namespace says cp4waiops. If not, using the drop down box select 'cp4waiops'. Then click "Install".

 When the operator installation is complete, select "View Operator":

## 1-3: Install an instance of AI Manager

 Now that the operator is installed, you can create instances of the AI Manager. From the Operator view, click on the "Create instance" Link in the AI Manager tile:

 ![](images/Picture8.png)

 You will be in the "Create Installation" configuration window. In this window, you will edit 4 entries:

 Accept the license:

 Set File Storage Class to 'ibmc-file-gold-gid'

 ![](images/Picture10.png)


 Set Large Block Storage Class to 'ibmc-block-gold'

 ![](images/Picture11.png)


 Image Pull Secret set to 'ibm-entitlement-key':

 ![](images/Picture12.png)

Set the size to "Small"

 ![](images/Picture13.png)


 When all of the options are configured, select the 'create' button.

 Next, You will be brought back to the installations view, where you will see a new entry called 'ibm-cp-watson-aiops' and will be able to watch the status as the creation of your new instance proceeds. After about 5-7 minutes, it should complete and you should see the "Phase" change to "Running":

The install will take around 90 minutes, and will be ready for you when you come to Lab 6 - working with Metric Anomaly Detection in Watson AIOps.
