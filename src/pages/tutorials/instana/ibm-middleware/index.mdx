## 5-1: Introduction

Positioning Instana at existing IBM customers often requires presenting Instana value proposition in context of other IBM middleware used by the client.
In this section, you will find guidence about configuring and using Instana with the following IBM technologies:

- MQ
- App Connect Enterprise (ACE)

---

## 5-2: Configure Quote of the Day Application to use MQ & ACE

The **"Quote of the Day"** application has been installed for you on the **manage-to** OpenShift cluster. For more information about the **Quote of the Day** application, you can go to this GitLab location: https://gitlab.com/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day (It is not necessary to go there, but you might be interested in learning more about the application.)

For the containerized portion of the application, some technologies are automatically instrumented for monitoring. In addition, the load generation tool is continuously running transactions against the application.

Let's verify that things are running. Issue the **oc get pods** command against the **qotd** namespace/project.

```sh
oc get pods -n qotd
```

You should see results similar to this:

![](images/qotdPods.png)

The next step is to modify the configuration of the Quote of the Day application so that it uses an external ACE and MQ server. By default, the engraving service runs as a cloud native call that doesn't really do anything. We want to modify the configuration so that the engraving service makes a REST API call to ACE and ACE subsequently calls MQ and puts a message on a queue.

You can do this by editing the deployment for the qotd-engraving.

Type the following command:

```sh
oc edit deployment qotd-engraving -n qotd
```

This will open a "vi" session. Scroll down within the file to line 49. You should see 3 lines of text like the following:

```sh
        - name: SUPPLY_CHAIN_URL
        - name: SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATE
          value: "true"
```

You need to modify those lines to look like the following. You need to add a "value" parameter that contains the SUPPLY_CHAIN_URL for the ACE flow. The flow within the
ACE server is **"http://&lt;acemq_ipaddress&gt;:7081/supplychain/v1/order"**. This is what you need to use for the SUPPLY_CHAIN_URL value, but replace **<acemq_ipaddress>** with the IP address of your ACE/MQ server. 

You'll also need to change the value for the SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATE to "false" to disable the simulation. 

When you are done, the lines should look like this:

```sh
        - name: SUPPLY_CHAIN_URL
          value: http://<acemq_ipaddress>:7081/supplychain/v1/order
        - name: SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATE
          value: "false"
```

HINT: Replace &lt;acemq_ipaddress&gt; with the IP address for your ACEMQ server

Type **":wq"** to save your changes and exit the file.

```sh
:wq
```

As soon as you save your changes, OpenShift will automatically redeploy the **"qotd-engraving"** pod with the updated configuration. To verify that the changes were applied successfully, let's check the application UI.

Type `oc get route -n qotd` to get the route for the application. Then, in the browser, open this URL with http://route and click the “Order Engraving” button. Then, click again the “Order Engraving” button. If successful, you’ll see “Order successfully placed.”

## 5-3: Configure ACE and MQ for Resource Monitoring

<span style="color:red">
  {" "}
  This section is for informational purposes only.  In your lab environment, these steps have already been performed.
</span>

This section of the lab will help you understand how IBM MQ and IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) need to be configured for monitoring. There are certain configuration settings within MQ and ACE that are required in order to get the
monitoring KPIs. The key KPI's that need to be enabled are Resource Stats and Flow Stats. The requirements are documented in the [sensor configuration guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/223?topic=technologies-monitoring-app-connect-enterprise#monitoring-ibm-app-connect-enterprise) that is online. You'll see links to those guides further down in this document.

Note: Typically, these steps are performed by the MQ and ACE admins, so you don't need to know the step by step procedure. But, you do need to tell the MQ/ACE admins what the monitoring requirements are.

---

### Verify the ACE configuration

The "Resource Monitoring" KPIs are already enabled in most customer environments. But it is worth validating the configuration. For example, you can use the
ACE `mqsireportresourcestats` and `mqsireportflowstats` commands to view the configuration for ACE.

Become root user on mqace node:
```sh
sudo -i
```

To run the following commands you have to source the `mqsiprofile`:

```sh
. /opt/ace-11.0.0.11/server/bin/mqsiprofile
```

> **&#9888; HINT: In the commands listed, BK1 is the Integration Node name and would be different if the Integration Node had a different name**

Here are example commands that you can issue to see the ACE configuration:

```sh
mqsireportresourcestats BK1 -e EG2
```

You will see results similar to those shown below. Notice that the "state" is set to "true" indicating that **"Resource Stats"** are enabled.

![](images/resourcestats.png)

To see the configuration of the "flow" stats, issue the following command:

```sh
mqsireportflowstats BK1 -s -e EG2
```

You will see results similar to those shown below. Notice that the "state" is "active", and the outputFormat is "json". This indicates that the **"Flow Stats"** are enabled. The product
requires that the output format be set to json vs. XML.

![](images/flowstats.png)

---

### Verify the MQ configuration

There are fewer requirements for MQ. The sensor will work with the default settings. However, you can have the sensor automatically use thresholds/Events that are
setup within the MQ server. If you want to use the built in MQ Events, then you need to set **CHLEV** (Channel Events) and **PERFMEV** (Performance Events) to **ENABLED**. To check those settings, you can issue the following commands.

Become root user on mqace node:
```sh
sudo -i
```

HINT: To run the following commands you have to source the `setmqenv` and specify the queue manager name (QM1):

```sh
. /opt/mqm/bin/setmqenv -m QM1
```

You first need to run the **"runmqsc"** command.

```sh
/opt/mqm/bin/runmqsc QM1
```

The **runmqsc** command won't prompt you with a cursor. That's okay. Just start typing the coomands.

Within the runmqsc command prompt you can issue other MQ commands. Type the following commands:

Then:

```sh
display QMGR PUBSUB CHLEV
```

```sh
display QMGR CLUSTER PERFMEV
```

These commands will give outputs similar to what's shown below.

![](images/2022-05-27-14-45-36.png)

In the output, you can see that the CHLEV (Channel Events) and PERFMEV (Performance Events) is set to disabled.

To enable run the following commands:

```sh
ALTER QMGR CHLEV(ENABLED)
ALTER QMGR PERFMEV(ENABLED)
```

Re-run the display command to verify that configuration was changed

![](images/2022-05-27-14-59-27.png)

Type **"quit"** to exit the runmqsc command prompt.

```sh
quit
```

## 5-4: Configure ACE and MQ for Tracing

<span style="color:red">The steps in this section have already been performed in your environment. The instructions found here are for informational purposes.</span>

In addition to the "Resource Monitoring" KPIs, additional settings are required to enable Tracing within IBM MQ and ACE. It is important that you understand this process since Tracing is typically not enabled by default in most IBM MQ and ACE environments. In this section, we've documented the steps.

Note: Typically, these steps are performed by the MQ and ACE admins, so you don't need to know the step by step procedure.

This section is simply going to describe the process.  The procedure is well documented within the Instana online documentation. You will find a **Tracing** section within the sensor documentation.

For ACE, you perform the following steps

- Download a small TAR file from IBM Fix Central. There are links within the [Instana documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/223?topic=technologies-monitoring-app-connect-enterprise#tracing).
- Extract the tar file into the **/var/mqsi/shared-classes** directory
- Stop the ACE server
- Run the following command to "Install" the **User Exit**: **mqsichangeflowuserexits BK1 -o -x /var/mqsi/shared-classes**
- Start the ACE server
- Activate the **User Exit** by typing: **mqsichangeflowuserexits BK1 -o -a ACEOpenTracingUserExit**

The MQ procedure is similar.

- Download a small TAR file from IBM Fix Central. There are links within the [Instana documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/223?topic=technologies-monitoring-mq#tracing).
- Extract the tar file to **/var/mqm/exits64**
- Edit the **/var/mqm/mqs.ini** file
- Add a small section within the **/var/mqm/mqs.ini** file. The content can be copied and pasted from the Instana documentation.
- Restart the Queue Manager

In the lab environment, these steps have already been performed. If you want, you can examine the files and directories specified above.

Note: Even though the TAR files for ACE and MQ look similar, they are unique for each middleware component.

---

## 5-5: Configure the ACE and MQ Sensors

In this section, you will perform these commands as root on the ACE/MQ server. 

From the control node, ssh to the ACE/MQ server. 

```sh
ssh jammer@mqace

```

Then, use sudo to switch to the root user.

```sh
sudo -i

```

After installing an Instana Agent, one of the first things you want to do is set a Zone name. This allows you to organize your Agents to make them easier to find. The Zones can also be used for custom queries, threshold distribution, and more. In your case, set the Zone name to **Quote of the Day** or something meaningful.

Change directory to `/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana`

```sh
cd /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana
```

This is the main configuration directory for the Instana Agent and sensors. There are few configuration files in the parent directory, but most of the important ones are here.

The **com.instana.agent.main.sender.Backend.cfg** file contains information on where the Agent is going to send the monitoring data. Back one directory, you'll see a file **/opt/instana/agent/etc/mvn-settings.xml** that is used to configure the use of an internal maven repository.

We are going to be editing the configuration.yaml file. This file contains all of the configuration settings for the sensors.

Take a backup before you actually edit the configuration.yaml file:
```sh
cp configuration.yaml configuration.yaml.bak
```
Edit configuration.yaml using either "vi" or use other editor like `nano` if you prefer.

```sh
vi configuration.yaml
```

**------------IMPORTANT------------**  
yaml files are very strict about indentation. Each line within the file must be indented by 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. spaces. Do not use tabs and do not indent by odd numbers
of characters. Make sure that all of the characters line up vertically within the text. If you see a line that is commented out and you need to uncomment it, just
remove the single "#" character.

Within the editor, scroll down to the section titled **"IBM ACE"**

You will need to uncomment the required entries and change the parameters to match the ACE/MQ configuration on this server. If you read the description on each line,
you'll see that some parameters are optional.

For more information about about the ACE configuration, view the online documentation found here: [link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-app-connect-enterprise)

There are multiple options for configuring the sensor. The information shown matches this particular environment. A few key possibilities:

- If ACE is configured for MQTT, the configuration will be different than if ACE is configured to use MQ.
- The configuration will be different if you are doing remote monitoring vs. local.
- Pay careful attention to the required vs. optional parameters. For example, in some environments the MQ Channel Authentication is disabled and you don't need to specify credentials.

Edit the **IBM ACE** section of the file so that it looks like this. If you want, you can copy this text and replace the entire section. Or, you can change the
individual parameters.   

When you paste this information, you must **replace <mqm password\> with the password provided by the lab proctor**.

```yaml
# IBM ACE
com.instana.plugin.ace:
  enabled: true
  poll_rate: 20
  NodesOrServers: # Multiple Integration node instances or multiple standalone Integration Servers can be specified
    BK1:     # specify the Integration node/server name (required)
      restApiPort: '4414'        # ACE rest api port (required)
      mqport: '1414'             # Sets the port for remote administration IBM MQ channel port or the MQTT server port (required)
      queuemanagerName: 'QM1'     # Queue Manager name (required for IBM MQ)
      channel: 'ACE.SVRCONN'             # Remote administration channel (required for IBM MQ)
      mqUsername: 'mqm'         # MQ channel authentication's username if security enabled (optional for IBM MQ)
      mqPassword: '<mqm password>'         # MQ channel authentication's password if security enabled (optional for IBM MQ)
```

Note: The markdown documentation only shows 9 rows of text, but there are more rows. You can either click the **Show more** button in the bottom right, or you can click on the **Copy** button in the top right corner.

![](images/ACEyaml.png)

In the example above, **QM1** is the Queue Manager name. **BK1** is the name of the Integration Server. **ACE.SVRCONN** is the channel that the sensor will conect to in order to query the performance KPIs. The username of **mqm** is the admin username for MQ, but the sensor does not require administrative permissions.  Any valid MQ user can be specified as long as it has permissions to connect to the channel.

Next, you will need to edit the MQ sensor settings. Scroll further down in the file until you find the section titled "IBM MQ". You will be editing this section of
the configuration to match the settings of the MQ server. There are a number of mandatory and optional parameters. For more information on the configuration settings,
see the online documentation: [link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-mq)

Edit the **IBM MQ** section of the file so that it looks like this. If you want, you can copy this text and replace the entire section. Or, you can change the
individual parameters. 

When you paste this information, you must **replace <mqm password\> with the password provided by the lab proctor**.

```yaml
# IBM MQ
com.instana.plugin.ibmmq:
  enabled: true
  poll_rate: 5
  queueManagers: # Multiple Queue Manager instances can be specified
    QM1:
      channel: 'ACE.SVRCONN' # Remote administration channel
      username: 'mqm'
      password: '<mqm password>'
```

---

## 5-6: Further Configuration

First, let's change the **Zone** name within the file. This is similar to the Zone that you specified when installing the Docker and OpenShift monitoring Agents. Scroll down until you see the section titled "Hardware & Zone". Uncomment the 3 lines of text starting with
`com.instana.plugin.generic.hardware`. By default the "availability-zone" parameter is set to "Datacenter A /Rack 42". Change the value to **ACE and MQ**

The section of the configuration.yaml file should look as follows:

```yaml
# Hardware & Zone
com.instana.plugin.generic.hardware:
  enabled: true # disabled by default
  availability-zone: 'ACE and MQ'
```

In addition to configuring the **Zone** name, you can specify tags within the configuration.yaml file. Search for the section within the configuration.yaml file titled **Host**. Within that section, you see a section for tags. By default this section will be commented out. Uncomment the **com.instana.plugin.host** section and specify some tags. For example, add a **production** tag to indicate that this system is a production server. And, add a **QOTD** tag to indicate that it supports the **Quote of the Day** application. Add a **Dallas** tag to indicate the the server resides in Dallas, Texas.

Add **production, QOTD, and Dallas** as tags. The configuration.yaml section should look as follows:

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.host:
 tags:
   - 'production'
   - 'QOTD'
   - 'Dallas'
```

It is possible to specify tags for the Docker and OpenShift versions of the Instana Agent, but we are not going to cover that in this lab.

Note: Zones and Tags can be used for a number of purposes within instana:

- Search for systems within the UI or via the APIs
- Assign thresholds to systems with a specific tag or zone name
- Build custom dashboards using the tags or zone names
  and more...

By default, Instana will monitor key processes that are related to the applications/middleware that are being monitored. It will also monitor processes that are consuming large amounts of CPU or Memory. Sometimes, customers want to ensure that specific processes are monitoring. Let's edit the configuration.yaml file to specify some key proccesses on this ACE/MQ server. Seach within the configuration.yaml file for **com.instana.plugin.process**

The section will be commented out by default. Uncomment the section and specify the following processes for monitoring **(crond, amqzmgr0, runmqlsr)**. One process is the cron daemon, which customers frequently want to monitor. The other two process are related to IBM MQ. The section should look like this:

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.process:
  processes:
    - 'crond'
    - 'amqzmgr0'
    - 'runmqlsr'
```

Note: There is also a section in the configuration.yaml file where you can specify processes that you want to ignore. Search for **com.instana.ignore**.

Save and exit the configuration.yaml file. In "vi", type ":wq" to save and exit the file.

As soon as you save your changes to the file, Instana will detect those changes and will start to implement what you have configured.

At this point, we recommend that you navigate to next section of this tutorial **6 - Explore Instana**.

![](images/exploreInstana_6.png)

In the **Explore Instana** section, we'll begin by confirming that the ACE and MQ monitoring are working propererly. If they are not, come back to this section and double check your configuraion.yaml settings and check that there are no obvious errors in the log file.

The main install log file is /opt/instana/agent/data/log/agent.log

## 5-7: Summary

You learned how to configure the Instana sensor for IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) and IBM MQ.  This includes customization such as defining tags, defining a zone, and identifying specific processes to monitor.

Now, proceed to section 6 where you will explore Instana.
