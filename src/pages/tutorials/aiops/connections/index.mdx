## 3-1: Overview

This module focuses on configuring and connecting an on-premise Netcool/Probe to the Event Manager.  In most scenarios, there will be an existing on-premise Netcool deployment present, or there will be a need to deploy some Netcool Probes, and so there will be a need to connect the on-premise components to the Event Manager system running on OpenShift. Typically this will involve connecting Probes or uni-directional ObjectServer Gateways into the Event Manager, to provide a source of events.

**NOTE:** This module uses on-premise OMNIbus Probe that you will connect to your Event Manager system.

**NOTE:** For the SWAT tech jams, Netcool/OMNIbus is pre-installed on a virtual machine (`pi-template`) in your environment which includes a Simnet Probe. Netcool/OMNIbus (`$NCHOME`) is installed in the following location: `/home/scadmin/IBM/tivoli/netcool` You can connect to this virtual machine using `ssh pi-template` from your control node.

This deployment scenario will assume you are deploying onto IBM Cloud however the steps would generally apply to an OpenShift cluster deployed on another cloud provider or on-premise.

By the end of this module, you will have enabled the ObjectServer nodeports on your cluster, configured your on-premise Netcool/OMNIbus system to connect to the ObjectServer embedded within Event Manager, and connected a Probe.


## 3-2: Enable the nodeports

Behind the scenes, the event stores in Watson for AIOps Event Manager are Netcool/OMNIbus ObjectServers. These are running in containers and are not accessible outside the cluster by default. This first step therefore involves modifying your Event Manager deployment to activate the nodeports so that the ObjectServers can be accessed from outside the cluster.

Log in to your OpenShift UI and navigate to: **Operators > Installed Operators > IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Event Manager > NOI**.

Next, click on your deployment - for example: **evtmanager** - and then click on the **YAML** tab.

Add a new sub-section to the **spec**: section in your configuration with the following text:

```sh
  helmValuesNOI:
    global.service.nodePort.enable: true
```

**NOTE**: the spacing and indentation is important here.

After you have added this sub-section and clicked Save, the resulting configuration should look something like the following:

![](images/0_yaml.png)

**NOTE:** In this screenshot, other properties have also been added. The key added lines are only lines **196** and **198**.

After you have saved the configuration, OpenShift will detect the change, and redeploy the relevant services.

For more information on this step, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-identifying-proxy-listening-port](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-identifying-proxy-listening-port)

## 3-3: Gather the cluster connection information

This step involves compiling information about the cluster's certificate common name (CN) and downloading the cluster certificate so that it can be imported into the Probe server's trusted key store.

**a) Find the IP address of the cluster Ingress subdomain**

In the previous module 2-6, you identified the **Ingress subdomain** from the IBM Cloud UI. Execute following command from your terminal session. Ping the Ingress subdomain to find the **IP address** to use to communicate with the cluster:

```sh

ping swat01-4693fb98e216XXXXXXXXXXX-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud

PING swat01-4693fb98e21XXXXXXXXXXXXx-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud (5X.XXX.XX.XXX) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc (10.20.30.40): icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=89.2 ms
^C
--- swat01-4693fb98e216d6XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1001ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 89.216/93.100/96.985/3.896 ms
```

In this example, we would use the IP address: 10.20.30.40 (from the above output) to communicate with the cluster.


**b) Find the Nodeports for proxy server running in the OCP cluster**

Next, log in to the OpenShift cluster via the terminal session (using `oc login`), as you did in the previous module. To check that the nodeports have been successfully deployed, you can query the Proxy Service, and check its output for the nodeport values:

```sh
oc get service -o yaml evtmanager-proxy -n noi | grep nodePort
```
The output will look something like :

```console
    nodePort: 30846
    nodePort: 31746
```


From the output above, you can see that the nodeports have been deployed on ports **30846** for the primary ObjectServer and **31846** for the backup. These are the port numbers that are externally accessible to the cluster and are what your Netcool Probe (or in-bound Netcool Gateway) will use to connect.

**c) Extract the Openshift cluster certificate**

Use the `openssl` command to retrieve the x.509 certificate that is returned by the proxy and verify the certificate common name (CN). To do this, you again need to use the Ingress subdomain value in conjunction with the nodeport value you discovered in Step 1 - for example:

```sh
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect swat01-469XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXc049-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:32767
```

`CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=1 CN = openshift-service-serving-signer@1645115959
verify return:1
depth=1 CN = openshift-service-serving-signer@1645115959
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc
verify return:1
Certificate chain
0 s:CN = evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc
...
`

Here you can see the proxy service name **evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc** being used by the server at depth=0 is associated with the certificate, and that it matches the hostname returned by the ping command earlier. This is important because the hostname we use to connect to the cluster must match that referred to in the certificate in order for the SSL connection to work correctly.

Finally, download the certificate from the cluster using the `oc` utility:

```sh
oc get secrets/signing-key -n openshift-service-ca -o template='{{index .data "tls.crt"}}' | base64 --decode > cluster-ca-cert.pem 
```

Copy this file (cluster-ca-cert.pem) to the server where your Netcool/Probe is installed in preparation for the next step.

```sh
scp cluster-ca-cert.pem jammer@pi-template:/tmp/
```

For more information on this step, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-configuring-tls-encryption-red-hat-openshift](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-configuring-tls-encryption-red-hat-openshift)

## 3-4: Configure the Probe to connect to the cluster

Now that we have the proxy service hostname, the nodeport of the primary ObjectServer, and the cluster's certificate, we are ready to configure the on-premise Netcool/OMNIbus Probe to connect to the Event Manager running in OCP.

**a) Log in to the Netcool/OMNIbus Probe server from your Control Node:**

```sh
ssh pi-template
```

**b) Add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` file with the cluster IP address and the proxy service hostname obtained previously:**

```sh
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

Append following entry:
`<cluster IP address from 3.3(a)> evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc`

For example:
```
10.20.30.40 evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc
```

This is the hostname (evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc) that we are going to use in the `omni.dat` interfaces file shortly.

**c) Add the following entry to the interfaces file**

Switch to user scadmin to perform the following tasks.

Edit the interfaces file located in: `$NCHOME/etc/omni.dat` 

```sh
sudo su - scadmin
export NCHOME=/home/scadmin/IBM/tivoli/netcool
vi $NCHOME/etc/omni.dat
```
Add the following entry to the end of the file:

```sh
[ROKS_AGG_P]
{
 Primary: evtmanager-proxy.noi.svc ssl <nodeport from section 3.3 (b)>
}
```

**NOTE:** The entry contains the string ssl which indicates that an encrypted connection should be used.

**d) Run nco_igen to update the interfaces file information**

```sh
$NCHOME/bin/nco_igen
```

**e) Create a keystore for the cluster cerificate***

If you haven't already created one previously, create a keystore on your Probe server to import the certificate into:

```sh
export NCHOME=/home/scadmin/IBM/tivoli/netcool
$NCHOME/bin/nc_gskcmd -keydb -create -db "$NCHOME/etc/security/keys/omni.kdb" -pw password -stash -expire 1000
```

**f) Copy the certificate you downloaded in Step 2 to the Probe server, and import it into your newly created keystore**

```sh
$NCHOME/bin/nc_gskcmd -cert -add -file /tmp/cluster-ca-cert.pem -db $NCHOME/etc/security/keys/omni.kdb -stashed
```

**g) Use the nco_ping utility to test the connection the ObjectServer**

```sh
$NCHOME/omnibus/bin/nco_ping ROKS_AGG_P
```
Output:
`NCO_PING: Server available.`

You are now ready to connect your Probe.

For more information on this step, see the following documentation link: [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-configuring-tls-encryption-red-hat-openshift](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=service-configuring-tls-encryption-red-hat-openshift)

## 3-5: Start the Simnet Probe

The final step is to start the Probe and connect it to the primary ObjectServer running in OpenShift. 

Using the Simnet Probe as an example, run the Probe in debug mode to ensure that the Probe can connect to the ObjectServer:

```sh
export OMNIHOME=/home/scadmin/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus
$OMNIHOME/probes/nco_p_simnet -server ROKS_AGG_P -messagelevel debug -messagelog stdout
```

You can check events in Event Viewer sent via the Simnet Probe.

After verifying a successful connection to the ObjectServer, you can run the Probe outside of debug mode, normally under Process Agent control.
