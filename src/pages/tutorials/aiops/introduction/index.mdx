NOTES for Watson for AIOps Event Manager modules :

- You can skip section 2.2 - your cluster is already created
- You will have an email with your dedicated cluster information, including your control VM
- The AIops OpenShift cluster is the one you will be installing Event Manager onto

- For any instructions that use the "oc" command (interacting with your cluster), use your "control" VM:

	1. Download the rsa_id and rsa_id.pub files to your laptop
	2. chmod 600 rsa_id (otherwise the ssh will fail)
	3. Connect with: ssh -i rsa_id jammer@10.20.30.40
	4. Log in to your cluster using the Login Command copied from the OpenShift UI

- You can obtain a trial license from: https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/login?formid=urx-51074
