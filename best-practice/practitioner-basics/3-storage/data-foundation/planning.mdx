# Planning

:::caution Work in progress

This section is being updated actively and full details will be published
shortly.

:::

This section covers design planning considerations for
[IBM Storage Fusion Data Foundation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-fusion/2.6?topic=foundation-introduction-fusion-data)
and
[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation)
in the context of IBM AIOps solutions.

Both solutions are based on [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/) and are
distributed software-defined solutions which provide block, file and object
storage capabilities for containerized workloads.

## Understanding capacity

These solutions are configured with a default replication factor of `3`, so the
first thing to understand when planning storage capacity is the notion of:

- **_Usable Capacity:_** The amount of storage available to consumers of the
  storage pool, i.e. the applications.

## Minimum OSD size

The recommended minimum device size for a backing OSD is `500GiB`.

This size allows headroom for storage solution maintenance processes to run
efficiently in conjunction with application data demands.
