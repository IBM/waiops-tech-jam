OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework with a collection of
software development kits (SDKs), vendor-neutral or vendor-agnostic APIs, and
tools for instrumentation. This technology can generate, collect, export, and
instrument telemetry data to analyze your platform's behavior and performance.
OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is designed to provide comprehensive insights
into distributed systems, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot complex
applications. By standardizing the way telemetry data is collected and
processed, OpenTelemetry helps ensure consistency and interoperability across
different platforms and tools.

One of the key advantages of OpenTelemetry is its flexibility and extensibility.
Developers can integrate it with various back-end systems and observability
tools, allowing them to tailor their monitoring solutions to specific needs.
Additionally, OpenTelemetry supports multiple programming languages, making it
accessible to a wide range of developers and applications.

OpenTelemetry is included in the Instana license, meaning users can leverage its
powerful capabilities without incurring additional costs. This integration
simplifies the process of setting up observability for applications monitored by
Instana, providing a seamless experience for users looking to enhance their
performance monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.

## 3.1 OpenTelemetry instrumentation

For the purpose of this lab, we will use the **OpenTelemetry Demo Application**.
The [source code is available here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo).

The OpenTelemetry Demo Application is a microservice-based application designed
to showcase the seamless integration with an Instana backend. This demo
highlights the capabilities of Instana in collecting OpenTelemetry data,
correlating OpenTelemetry tracing with the underlying monitored infrastructure,
and demonstrating trace continuity between Instana tracing and OpenTelemetry.

The OpenTelemetry Demo Application has already been installed for you in the lab
environment, providing a ready-to-use setup for exploring its features. To
enable OpenTelemetry in the Instana agent, we will follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Instana Agent**: Ensure the Instana agent is properly
   configured to collect OpenTelemetry data.
2. **Instrument Your Application**: Integrate OpenTelemetry SDKs into your
   application code to start generating telemetry data. This includes adding
   tracing and metrics instrumentation to capture relevant data points.
3. **Verify Data Collection**: Check that the Instana agent is successfully
   collecting and correlating OpenTelemetry data. Use Instana's dashboard to
   monitor the incoming telemetry and ensure trace continuity.
4. **Analyze and Optimize**: Utilize Instana's analytics tools to analyze the
   collected data, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize your
   application's performance based on the insights gained.

By following these steps, you can fully leverage the capabilities of
OpenTelemetry and Instana to achieve robust monitoring and observability for
your microservice-based applications.

##  3.2 OpenTelemetry signals

OpenTelemetry signals are the core components used to capture and represent telemetry data from software systems, enabling observability into their behavior and performance.
These signals come in three primary forms: traces, metrics, and logs.

1. **Traces** provide insight into the flow of requests through distributed systems, helping identify bottlenecks and latency issues.
2. **Metrics** offer numerical data about system performance, such as CPU usage, request counts, or error rates, which are essential for monitoring and alerting.
3. **Logs** contain timestamped records of events that occur within a system, useful for debugging and auditing.

Together, these signals form a view of system health and performance, allowing developers and operators to detect, diagnose, and resolve issues more effectively.
OpenTelemetry standardizes the collection and export of these signals, making it easier to integrate with various observability tools.

Instana is capable of monitoring OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, and logs. The lab is going to focus on tracing and logs.

##  3.3 Enable OpenTelemetry in Instana agent

By default, the OpenTelemetry data ingestion in the Instana host agent is activated. There are no actions which you need to take
in order to enable the data ingestion. The example of a configuration.yaml with the manually enabled OpenTelemetry ingestion
looks like below

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.opentelemetry:
  grpc:
    enabled: true
  http:
    enabled: true
```

You can confirm, the Instana agent is waiting for the data by checking, if the agent is exposing Otel standard ports - `4317` and `4318`. In order to check it, please run
the below command against the `demo-apps` K3S cluster:

```bash title="Host: demo-apps"
kubectl get services -n instana-agent
```

You should be able to see a similar response to the one presented below:

![otel-010](images/otel-instrumentation-010.png)

:::tip The OpenTelemetry data ingestion can be disabled.

For more details, please check the Instana
[agent documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-agent#enabling-the-opentelemetry-data-ingestion).

## 3.4 Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application state

Let's find out if the OpenTelemetry Demo Application pods are up and healthy by
running the below command:

```bash title="Host: demo-apps"
kubectl get pods -n otel-demo
```

You should be able to see similar results as shown below:

![otel-011](images/otel-instrumentation-011.png)

Having pods in a `RUNNING` state will ensure the OpenTelemetry Demo
Application is working.

:::tip

In case some of the pods are in a non-running
state, try to restart them using the below command:

```bash title="Host: demo-apps"
kubectl delete pod <REPLACE-WITH-POD-NAME> -n otel-demo
```

:::

## 3.5 Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application configuration

As stated in the beginning of this lab, the Demo application has already been
pre-configured to work with the Instana agent. Let's see an example location of
the configuration, where you can see, how the link between application and
Instana agent looks like.

Let's check what the OpenTelemetry Demo application `configmap` looks like by
running this command:

```bash title="Host: demo-apps"
kubectl edit configmap -n otel-demo
```

As a result, you will see a long configuration file with all of the
application-specific settings.

![otel-012](images/otel-instrumentation-012.png)

Now, let's find the port `4317` which we already know, the agent is waiting for
the OpenTelemetry data. Search the file by typing the below command:

```bash
?4317
```

and then hit `n` for the next result, you should see a direct link to an Instana
agent port `4317` configured within the configmap:

![otel-013](images/otel-instrumentation-013.png)

This is the confirmation that the OpenTelemetry Demo Application was configured
to send OpenTelemetry data to the Instana agent on port `4317`.

You can now close the configmap by hitting ESC and typing

```bash
:q!
```

## 3.6 Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application live state

Your instance of OpenTelemetry Demo Application is available under the
https://otel-demo.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local. Let's use a browser to open that
page. Please note the **https** in the address bar. Also, do not worry about the
security message - accept the self-signed certificate.

![otel-014](images/otel-instrumentation-014.png)

If you are able to see the page presented within the above picture, it means the
application is up and delivering content correctly.

## 3.7 Summary

So far you have been able to accomplish the following:

1. Have installed the Instana agent on the `demo-apps` cluster.
2. Have the the agent accepting the OpenTelemetry data on ports `4317` and
   `4318`.
3. Have the OpenTelemetry Demo Application installed on the cluster.
4. Have the demo application configured to send OpenTelemetry data to the
   agent's hostname on port `4317`.
5. Have the demo application accessible in the browser.

Now, it's time to move to the next step, please continue to the next section of
the lab.
