# OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework with a collection of software development kits (SDKs), vendor-neutral or 
vendor-agnostic APIs, and tools for instrumentation. This technology can generate, collect, export, and instrument telemetry data 
to analyze your platform's behavior and performance. OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is designed to provide comprehensive insights 
into distributed systems, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot complex applications. By standardizing the way telemetry data is 
collected and processed, OpenTelemetry helps ensure consistency and interoperability across different platforms and tools.

One of the key advantages of OpenTelemetry is its flexibility and extensibility. Developers can integrate it with various back-end 
systems and observability tools, allowing them to tailor their monitoring solutions to specific needs. Additionally, OpenTelemetry 
supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and applications.

OpenTelemetry is included in the Instana license, meaning users can leverage its powerful capabilities without incurring additional costs. 
This integration simplifies the process of setting up observability for applications monitored by Instana, providing a seamless experience 
for users looking to enhance their performance monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.


# OpenTelemetry instrumentation

For the purpose of this lab, we will use OpenTelemetry Demo Application. 
The source code is available here https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo.

The OpenTelemetry Demo Application is a microservice-based application designed to showcase the seamless 
integration with an Instana backend. This demo highlights the capabilities of Instana in collecting OpenTelemetry data, 
correlating OpenTelemetry tracing with the underlying monitored infrastructure, and demonstrating trace continuity 
between Instana tracing and OpenTelemetry.

The OpenTelemetry Demo Application has already been installed for you in the lab environment, 
providing a ready-to-use setup for exploring its features. To enable OpenTelemetry in the Instana agent, 
we will follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Instana Agent**: Ensure the Instana agent is properly configured to collect OpenTelemetry data. 
2. **Instrument Your Application**: Integrate OpenTelemetry SDKs into your application code to start generating telemetry data. 
This includes adding tracing and metrics instrumentation to capture relevant data points.
3. **Verify Data Collection**: Check that the Instana agent is successfully collecting and correlating OpenTelemetry data. 
Use Instana's dashboard to monitor the incoming telemetry and ensure trace continuity.
4. **Analyze and Optimize**: Utilize Instana's analytics tools to analyze the collected data, identify performance bottlenecks, 
and optimize your application's performance based on the insights gained.

By following these steps, you can fully leverage the capabilities of OpenTelemetry and Instana to achieve robust monitoring and observability for 
your microservice-based applications.

## OpenTelemetry signals

OpenTelemetry signals are the core components used to capture and represent telemetry data from software systems, enabling observability into their behavior and performance. 
These signals come in three primary forms: traces, metrics, and logs. 

1. **Traces** provide insight into the flow of requests through distributed systems, helping identify bottlenecks and latency issues. 
2. **Metrics** offer numerical data about system performance, such as CPU usage, request counts, or error rates, which are essential for monitoring and alerting. 
3. **Logs** contain timestamped records of events that occur within a system, useful for debugging and auditing. 

Together, these signals form a view of system health and performance, allowing developers and operators to detect, diagnose, and resolve issues more effectively. 
OpenTelemetry standardizes the collection and export of these signals, making it easier to integrate with various observability tools.

Instana is capable of monitoring OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, and logs. The lab is going to focus on tracing and logs.

## Enable OpenTelemetry in Instana agent

By default, the OpenTelemetry data ingestion in the Instana host agent is activated. There are no actions which you need to take
in order to enable the data ingestion. The example of a configuration.yaml with the manually enabled OpenTelemetry ingestion
looks like below 

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.opentelemetry:
  grpc:
    enabled: true
  http:
    enabled: true
```

You can confirm, the Instana agent is waiting
for the data by checking, if the agent is exposing Otel standard ports - 4317 and 4318. In order to check it, please run 
the below command against the "demo-apps" K3S cluster

```bash
kubectl get services -n instana-agent
```

You should be able to see similar response, to the one presented below

![otel-010](images/otel-instrumentation-010.png)

:::tip 
The OpenTelemetry data ingestion can be disabled. For more details, please
check the Instana agent documentation https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-agent#enabling-the-opentelemetry-data-ingestion
:::

## Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application state

Let's find out if the OpenTelemetry Demo Application pods are up and healthy, by running the below command

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otel-demo
```

You should be able to see similar results, as presented on the below picture 

![otel-011](images/otel-instrumentation-011.png)

Having pods in RUNNING state will guarantee, that the OpenTelemetry Demo Application will works just fine. 
In case some of the pods are in CRASH state, try to restart them by the below command

```bash
kubectl delete pod [POD NAME REPLACE THIS] -n otel-demo
```

## Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application configuration

As stated in the beginning of this lab, the Demo application has been already pre-configured to work with Instana agent.
Let's see an example location of the configuration, where you can see, how the link between application and Instana agent
looks like.

Let's check how the "configmap" of OpenTelemetry Demo application looks like, by running this command

```bash
kubectl edit configmap -n otel-demo
```
As a result, you will see a long configuration file with all of the application-specific settings. 

![otel-012](images/otel-instrumentation-012.png)

Now, let's find
the port "4317" which we already know, the agent is waiting for the OpenTelemetry data. Search the file by typing 
the below command

```bash
?4317
```
and then hit "n" for the next result, you should see a direct link to an Instana agent port 4317 configured within the configmap

![otel-013](images/otel-instrumentation-013.png)

This is the confirmation, that the OpenTelemetry Demo Application was configured to send OpenTelemetry data to Instana agent
on port 4317.

You can now close the configmap by hitting ESC and typing 

```bash
:q!
```
## Verify OpenTelemetry Demo Application live state

Your instance of OpenTelemetry Demo Application is available under the
https://otel-demo.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local. Let's use a browser to open that
page. Please note the **https** in the address bar. Also, do not worry about the
security message - accept the self-signed certificate.

![otel-014](images/otel-instrumentation-014.png) 

If you are able to see the page presented within the above picture, it means the application is up and delivering content 
correctly.

## Summary

So far you have been able to accomplish the below steps:
1. There's an installed and running Instana agent on the cluster,
2. The agent accepts the OpenTelemetry data on ports 4317 and 4318,
3. There's up and running OpenTelemetry Demo Application installed on the cluster,
4. The Demo Application is configured to send OpenTelemetry data to the agent's hostname on port 4317,
5. The Demo Application is reachable in the browser.

Now, it's time to move to the next step, please continue to the next section of the lab.
