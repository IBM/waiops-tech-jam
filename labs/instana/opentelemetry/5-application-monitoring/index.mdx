# Application Perspective in Instana

In the section of the labs, we will create an Application Perspective in
Instana, so that we can see all of the metrics and traces collected from the
OpenTelemetry Demo Application.

An Application Perspective in Instana is a feature designed for monitoring,
alerting, and analyzing microservice environments. It allows users to
dynamically scope the visibility of their applications to focus on specific
services, dependencies, technologies, business transactions, user journeys,
deployment engines, versions, or releases.

Key features and benefits of Application Perspectives:

1. **Focused Monitoring**: Application Perspectives help teams stay focused on
   the services they are interested in, reducing distractions from unrelated
   components. This targeted approach ensures that alerts, errors, and logs are
   scoped to the relevant application perspective, streamlining troubleshooting.
2. **Dynamic Scoping**: Users can specify subsets of services and their
   dependencies based on various criteria such as zones, clusters, technologies,
   or cluster namespaces. This flexibility allows for customized monitoring
   setups that meet specific needs.
3. **Security and Visibility**: Organizations can use Application Perspectives
   to limit visibility to certain infrastructure and services, enhancing
   security by controlling access to sensitive data.
4. **Automated Dashboards**: Each Application Perspective auto-generates a
   feature-rich monitoring dashboard that displays key metrics and golden
   signals, providing a comprehensive view of the application's health and
   performance.

## Create an Application in Instana

Let's create an application perspective in Instana. Log in to your Instana UI
and create a new application perspective as described in the below picture:

![otel-015](images/otel-app-015.png)

Switch to "Advanced mode" and provide all necessary values like name of your 
choice, scope.

To configured the "Scope" please type "kubernetes pod" and then select 
"namespace" as described on the below picture

![otel-015](images/otel-app-019.png) 

Once the scope is configured, select "All downstream services" and "All calls", 
click "Create".

In a few moments, the new Application Perspective will be created. The scope
will be limited only to the defined area - in your case, Instana will display
data only for pods located under the `otel-demo` namespace.

:::note

Please note the fact, that Application Perspective will not present data from
the time before its creation. Application Perspective will collect data only
from the moment of when it was defined.

## Review Application Perspective

After a few minutes, you should be able to see the metrics collected and
displayed as a part of your new Application Perspective.

Please navigate to the **otel-demo** Application Perspective to review the
content.

:::tip

Presented traces and metrics are coming directly from the OpenTelemetry Demo
Application using OpenTelemetry protocol. During this lab, we have not installed
or configured tracing collection from native Instana toolbox.

## Summary

In this section, you've learnt how to create an Application Perspective. Please
proceed to the next section of the labs.
