---

## 2.1: Introduction

Instana backend is available as SaaS (prefered option) or self hosted (aka
onPrem). For on-premises installation, Instana offers multiple options:

- Single Server **self-hosted** is a Dockerized deployment that does not support
  multi-tenancy. Self-Hosted is what Instana calls its on-premises deployments.
  Of course, on-premises could be deployed into a public cloud, but is not a
  recommended approach.
- Two server Dockerized **self-hosted** configuration with the datastores on one
  server and the other components on another. This option is also single-tenant.
- Small scale kubernetes deployment with the cloud native components running in
  a kubernetes cluster and the datastores running on a Docker host. This
  configuration is multi-tenant.
- Large scale kubernetes deployments run the cloud native portion in kubernetes
  and the datastores distributed across multiple servers. For assistance with
  architecture/planning, contact the SWAT team or open a
  [SWAT Request](http://ibm.biz/automation-swat) request.
- OpenShift support is currently in Tech Preview.

For informational purposes, on-prem (self-hosted) releases are delivered every 4
weeks. The release have odd numbers such as 225, 227, 229, etc. When upgrading,
you may upgrade from N-1 or N-2, but you can't skip more than one release. So,
you can upgrade from 225 to 229, but not to 231. Even numbered releases are for
SaaS only. SaaS is upgraded every 2 weeks.

You will be performing and on-line installation during this Tech Jam, but
Instana does support off-line (air-gapped) installs.

## 2.2: Prerequisites

For the installation of the Instana server, we'll be following the instructions
layed out in the Instana documentation for a **Self-Hosted Instana backend on
Docker** The instructions can be found here for your reference, but you can
follow the steps below.
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-self-hosted-backend-docker-premises

This is Instana's smallest on-premises installation option. Production and
larger deployments are installed into kubernetes for horizontal scale and
resiliency.

For the lab, you were assigned a virtual machine labeled the **control node**.
From a terminal window, ssh into the control using the id_rsa file that you
previously downloaded as shown. Replace <IP address of the control node\> with
your control node IP address:

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa jammer@<IP address of control node>
```

Once you are logged onto the control node, ssh to the Instana server by issuing
the following command:

:::caution

You must do this from the Control Node

:::

```sh
ssh jammer@instana
```

Once you are logged onto the Instana server node, use sudo to become root.

```sh
sudo -i
```

Instana has a few prerequisites for installing the server. Some of those have
been setup for you. Others, you will need to perform the installation. For
example, the firewall ports required for Agent, UI, and EUM communications have
already been configured in the OS firewall.

Instana requires a Linux server with 16 cores, 64 Gig of RAM and few hundred Gig
of disk space for a POC sized deployment. It also requires fast backend storage.
For environments with even a few hundred servers, you'll need 6000 IOPS or more.
For larger deployments, you'll need more capacity. Several different versions of
Linux are supported. We have chosen Ubuntu 20.04 for this environment.

Prior to installing Instana, you must install Docker CE or Docker EE. Run the
following commands to setup the prerequisites, download Docker CE, and install
Docker CE on the virtual machine.

```sh
apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y
```

```sh
mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
```

```sh
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

```sh
echo   "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

```sh
apt-get update -y
```

```sh
apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin -y
```

After the commands have executed, verify that docker is installed and running.
You can issue **docker ps** command to confirm that it is installed and running.
If docker is running, you should see output similar to what's shown below.

![](images/docker.png)

Next, we want to pin the major version of Instana so that we don't get updates
during the lab. Issue the following command to pin the Instana version.

```sh
cat >/etc/apt/preferences.d/instana-console <<EOF
Package: instana-console
Pin: version 231-1
Pin-Priority: 1000
EOF

```

Next, create the following directories and/or filesystems that will be used for
the Instana datastores (/mnt/metrics, /mnt/traces, /mnt/data). Ideally, these
directories/filesystems should be setup on fast storage volumes with a separate
filesystem for each because the datastores are very I/O intensive. Even during a
POC, these filesystems can become fairly large. Plan for a minimum of 20 Gig for
the **data** directory, 200 Gig for the **metrics** directory, and 40 Gig for
the **traces** directory. Production environments will be much larger and need
to be planned for based on the size of the environment.

```sh
mkdir /mnt/metrics
mkdir /mnt/traces
mkdir /mnt/data

```

Normally, you would also need to ensure that the virtual machine has the correct
ports opened in the firewall. We have already done this work for you. For
reference, here are the ports that need to be opened for the Instana Server for
an on-prem deployment. The ports for SaaS are slightly different.
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=premises-installing-instana-backend-docker#network-security-notes

You are now ready to start the installation of the Instana Server.

---

## 2.3: Installing Instana Server

Run the following commands to install the Instana Server. These commands will
vary depending on which Linux platform you are using for your installation. The
instructions below are for Ubuntu and Debian.

Begin by installing the Instana package by issuing the following commands. Make
sure the command is successful before proceding to the next command.

```sh
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://self-hosted.instana.io/apt generic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/instana-product.list
```

```sh
wget -qO - "https://self-hosted.instana.io/signing_key.gpg" | apt-key add -
```

```sh
apt-get update -y
```

```sh
apt-get upgrade -y
```

```sh
apt-get install instana-console -y
```

This will install the "instana" command on the server.

Now let's create the working directory for instana server installation:

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/instana && cd /opt/instana
```

Make sure to prepare Instana server IP address - it will be needed during the installation. You can find it by typing below command:

```sh
cat /etc/hosts
```
![](images/instana-server-ip.png)

Next, run the **instana init** command to install the Instana server. You will
be prompted for additional information during the install.

```sh
instana init
```

When you run the **instana init** command, it generates a file named
settings.hcl in your current directory. It is important to save this file. The
settings.hcl file contains the configuration settings for your deployment. It
can be used to enable additional features and make other configuration settings
in the future.

You will be prompted to select **single**, **dual-instana**, or
**dual-clickhouse**. Type **Enter** to select **single**

![](images/single.png)

Next, you will be prompted to enter a tenant name for your Instana server. This
can be any string. In a single server installation, the tenant name doesn't
really matter, but in multi-tenant or SaaS environment, the tenant name is very
important because it becomes part of the URL to access the Instana server.
Customers frequently use their company name for the tenant.

![](images/tenant.png)

Next, you will be prompted to enter a unit name. In a single server
installation, the unit name doesn't really matter, but in multi-tenant or SaaS
environment, the unit name is very important because it becomes part of the URL
to access the Instana server. Customers frequently use a business unit or Dev,
Test, Prod to identify the unit.

![](images/unit.png)

You will now be prompted for your **agent key**. This will be provided to you by
the lab proctors.

![](images/agentKey.png)

The next step is to enter your **download key**. Use the same key as your
**agent key** from the previous step.

![](images/downloadKey.png)

Next, enter your **sales key**. This will be provided to you by the lab
proctors.

![](images/salesKey.png)

Next, you will be prompted for the fully qualified hostname of the server.
Normally, you would enter a fully qualified hostname, but these servers are not
in DNS.

:::caution Important

Instead of specifying the hostname, enter the **IP address** of the Instana
server.

:::

If you are not sure what the IP address is, you cat the /etc/hosts file and find
the instana hostname and IP address.

![](images/hostname.png)

You will now be prompted for the path where your data will be stored. The
default path is /mnt/data. Press **Enter** to accept the default value.

![](images/data.png)

You will now be prompted for the path where your traces will be stored. The
default path is /mnt/traces. Press **Enter** to accept the default value.

![](images/traces.png)

Next, you will be prompted for the path where your metric data will be stored.
The default path is /mnt/metrics. Press **Enter** to accept the default value.

![](images/metrics.png)

You will be prompted for the location of the Instana logs. Press **Enter** to
accept the default value of /var/log/instana.

![](images/logs.png)

Finally, you will be prompted for the path to your signed certificate file. If
desired, you can create your own. If you don't provide one, the installer will
generate a certificate. Press **Enter** and let Instana generate a self-signed
certificate. If you were deploying at a customer site and the customer wanted to
user CA signed certificates, this is the step where you would specify the
existing certificate.

![](images/certificate.png)

You will be prompted for the private key file. For this lab, press **Enter** and
have the install generate the key file for the self-signed certificate.

![](images/key.png)

Instana will now begin the installation process. It will take 20 to 30 minutes
to complete the installation process.

At the end of the installation, you will be shown the URL to access the Instana
server and a username of **admin@instana.local** and a **password**. Save this
information so that you can use it later to login to the Instana user interface.

The output should look something like this:

![](images/installSuccess.png)

If you forget the password, you can use the following command to reset the
admin@instana.local password: **instana configure admin -p <password for
admin\>**

Before attempting to login to your Instana server, activate the license using
the steps in section 2.4.

:::tip

If at any time you need to
[restart Instana](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=premises-operations-docker-based-instana#stopping-all-components)
you can run the `instana stop` and `instana start` commands.

:::

---

## 2.4: Activate the license

After completing the installation, you must activate the license. We suggest you
run the following commands in your working directory hence the license file will
store here:

```sh
cd /opt/instana
```

Run the following command to download the license:

```sh
instana license download
```

![](images/licenseDownload_opt_instana.png)

Next, import the license to activate your license:

```sh
instana license import
```

![](images/licenseImport_opt_instana.png)

You can verify the license by typing:

```sh
instana license verify
```

![](images/licenseVerify_opt_instana.png)

---

## 2.5: Launch the Instana User interface

You are now ready to open a browser and login to the Instana user interface.

Open a firefox browser. Other browsers can be used, but you would need to setup
the server as a trusted URL due to the self-signed certificate.

Enter an HTTPS URL with the IP address of the Instana server. You would have
seen this URL at the end of step 2.3. Example: https://\<IP address\>/

When prompted, enter the username and password that you saved earlier. The
username is **admin@instana.local**

![](images/login.png)

You will be taken to an Initial Screen where you can install the instana agents
or navigate to the main product UI. We will perform these steps in another
section of the lab.

![](images/initialScreen.png)

## 2.6: Turning on features and setting up SMTP

Following the initial install of your Instana server, there are optional
configurations that you will likely want to make. First, you need to setup the
Instana server to use an SMTP server if you plan to send out Email
notifications. Second, there may be some optional features that you want to
enable via feature flags. Features such as VMware/vSphere monitoring, Power HMC
monitoring, and zHMC monitoring are disabled by default.

Follow the steps below to configure the SMTP settings and enable some additional
feature flags.

1. Edit `settings.hcl` file according to the
   [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=installer-enabling-feature-flags).
   The **settings.hcl** file will be located in the same directory where you
   issued the **instana init** command.

These parameters are added to the settings.hcl file in the section with the
other feature flags. Search in the settings.hcl file for **feature**. Then, add
any additional feature flags that are desired in that section of the file. They
can be place anywhere within the **feature** section of the file.

> **WARNING: Be aware that turning on features (especially BETA ones) may
> heavily impact backend performance. DO NOT turn on features you don't need**

As we issued **instana init** from the working directory `/opt/instana`, the
`settings.hcl` has been created there:

```sh
cd /opt/instana
```

Before using vi to edit the settings.hcl file, make a backup of the file by
typing:

```sh
cp settings.hcl settings.hcl.bak
```

In your lab enviroment, we want you to add the following feature flags.

```java
feature "infraCustomDashboards" {
  enabled = true
} 
feature "infraEntityExplore" {
  enabled = true
}
```

:::info

Note: There are other feature flags that you should be aware of, <span
style={{color: "red"}}> but do not add these into the settings.hcl file</span>.
Here are some common feature flags available are:

```java
feature "vsphereEnabled" {
  enabled=true
} 
feature "zhmcEnabled" {
  enabled=true
}
feature "phmcEnabled" {
  enabled=true
}
feature "beeinstana" {
  enabled=true
}
feature "smartAlertsLogsBlueprintEnabled" {
  enabled=true
}
feature "infraCustomDashboards" {
  enabled = true
}
feature "infraEntityExplore" {
  enabled = true
}
```

:::

Next, search for the **smtp** section in the settings.hcl file. Modify the smtp
section to look something like this. We recommend that you edit the paramters
rather than copy/paste this section. It is easy to make a mistake with the
spacing when doing a copy/paste.

```sh
  smtp {
    from      = "server@instana.com"
    host      = "localhost"
    port      = 25
    user      = "jammer"
    password  = "<jammer password provided by proctors>"
    use_ssl   = false
    start_tls = false
  }
```

Replace **<jammer password\>** with the jammer password of the Instana server
that was provided by the lab proctors. If you want, you can replace the **from**
parameter with any Email address that you like. The **from** Email address is
what you will see as the sender of the Email alerts from Instana. All of the
rest of the parameters should match what you see on the screen.

Save the changes in the settings.hcl file.

2. Run `instana update -f ./settings.hcl` to apply changes.

```sh
instana update -f ./settings.hcl

```

It will take a little while for the configuration changes to take effect. [Read
section 2-7](#27-upgrading-the-instana-server) while the configuration changes are being applied.

## 2.7: Upgrading the Instana server

:::warning

Do NOT perform these steps. But we want you to know the process for performing
an upgrade.

:::

When upgrading an Instana server, it is important to know that you can only skip
one release when upgrading. The on-prem/self-hosted releases use odd numbers.
That means that you can upgrade from version 225 to either 227 or 229. But, you
can't upgrade from 225 to 231 because that would be skipping 2 releases and
isn't supported. It is important for customers to know this because they need to
keep their Instana server patched on a fairly regular basis. Otherwise, it will
mean that they will have to perform multiple steps to upgrade to the current
version.

Before attempting to upgrade, you want to confirm your current version. Issue
the **instana version**

```sh
instana version
```

Next, find out what versions are available to be installed. Issue the the
following command:

```sh
apt-cache policy instana-console
```

You will see a long list of versions that are available. Scroll to the top of
the list where you will see the most recent versions. ![](images/versions.png)

You'll notice that in this example, 229-2 is the most recent version and 229-1
is the current version. That means you can upgrade to that minor release. There
is newer major release available.

First, install the latest instana-console. This upgrades the **instana** command
that is installed on your server:

```sh
apt install instana-console=229-2
```

Next, upgrade the server by issuing the **instana update** command. If you are
in directory with the settings.hcl file, then you don't need any arguments.
Otherwise, specify the path to the settings.hcl file.

```sh
instana update -f /opt/instana/settings.hcl
```

When performance the upgrade, the installer automatically pulls down the latest
docker containers and gets them up and running on the Instana server.

---

## 2.8: Summary

In this portion of the lab, you have learned how to install a self-hosted docker
based Instana server. For a POC, we recommend either SaaS or the single server
self-hosted docker installation of the Instana server. For production
deployments, customers will want the kubernetes based deployments to gain
improved scalability and resiliency.

You have also learned how to configure the SMTP settings and how to enable
feature flags.

Finally, you learned how to upgrade a docker based self-hosted Instana server.

You are now ready to continue with other portions of the lab. Navigate to
section 3 of the Instana lab.
