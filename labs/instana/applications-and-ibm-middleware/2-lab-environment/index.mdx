## Requesting an environment as an Individual

If you are an IBMer or IBM Business Partner you can request an environment for
yourself on [IBM Tech Zone](https://techzone.ibm.com).

Navigate to the
[Jam-in-a-Box](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/jam-in-a-box-for-aiops)
collection. You will need to Sign in with your IBM ID.

![jam-in-a-box](../../../_common/images/jam-in-a-box.png)

Select **Environments** from the left navigation menu and select **Reserve**.

![reserve-env](../../../_common/images/reserve-env.png)

Select when you would like to reserve the environment for.

![reserve-env-schedule](../../../_common/images/reserve-env-schedule.png)

Fill in the reservation details and select **Submit**

![create-reservation](../../../_common/images/create-reservation.png)

You will receive an email with your environment details provisioning has
completed.

Once you have your environment details, navigate to the **OCP Console** URL that
looks similar to:

```sh
https://remote.cloud.techzone.ibm.com/guacamole/#/?username=000-000000-0000&password=00000
```

You will see a page similar to the below. Expand the _twisties_ and select the
**Remote Desktop** connection to connect to your _Apache Guacamole_ bastion
node.

![access-guacamole](../../../_common/images/access-guacamole.png)

All access to the environment is behind this RHEL Guacamole Bastion host named
**bastion-gym-lan**.

![guacamole](../../../_common/images/guacamole.png)

If you see the bastion hosts desktop environment you can proceed to
[the labs](/waiops-tech-jam/labs/general/).
