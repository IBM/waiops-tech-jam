# Introduction

In the first lab of the Instana Jam-in-a-box series you will be going through
several key exercises that will help you learn more about the installation and
configuration of the Instana Server and Instana Agent. You will cover topics
such as:

- The installation process for a single server self-hosted Docker based Instana.
- Licensing the Instana Server.
- Configuring SMTP for the Instana Server.
- Installing the Instana Agent into a variety of environments (OpenShift,
  Docker, and Linux server).
- Troubleshooting steps you can take if the Agent doesn't appear to be
  connecting to the Server correctly.

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed
in prior sections.
