# Lab Environment

The lab environment includes 2 Openshift clusters and 3 VMs.

Openshift clusters:

1. **AIOps cluster** - A full installation of OCP that will be used to install
   Turbonomic.
2. **Apps cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that will be used to
   install the Instana and KubeTurbo agents and the sample _RobotShop_
   application. The _Quote Of The Day_ sample application has been
   pre-installed.

Virtual Machines:

1. **Guacamole VM** - A RHEL VM that will be used as the _bastion_ host into the
   lab network. Guacamole has access to all lab VM's and clusters and will be
   your primary workstation for these labs.
2. **Instana** - An Ubuntu VM that will be used to install a single node
   self-hosted Instana server.
3. **MQACE** - An Ubuntu VM that contains the pre-installed IBM ACE and MQ
   middleware.
