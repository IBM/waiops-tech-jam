# Lab Environment

The lab environment includes 6 VMs.

1. **Bastion VM** - A RHEL VM named `bastion-gym-lan` that will be used as the
   _bastion host_ for the lab network. This Bastion host has access to all lab
   VM's and will be your primary workstation for these labs.
2. **Instana VMs** - 3 Ubuntu VMs that will be used to install a multi-node
   self-hosted Instana server on K3s.
3. **MQACE** - An Ubuntu VM that contains the pre-installed IBM ACE and MQ
   middleware. This VM will be used to install the Instana agent and monitor the
   middleware.
4. **Demo Applications Cluster** - An Ubuntu VM running K3s that will be used to
   install the Instana agent and demo applications.
