# Agent Installation

## 4.1: Instana Agent Deployment Options

Instana has a variety of agent installation options including the mirror
repository and static agents that allow customers to meet strict change control
processes. Some of the available options are listed below:

- OS specific installer (Linux, MacOS, Windows, UNIX)
- Container setup
- Docker (and other container managers)
- Kubernetes
- OpenShift
- Hosted Cloud Services
- Serverless component

All above mentioned methods are accessible via the wizard on the Instana UI

:::caution

If you are unable to access the Instana Web UI you will need to go back through
the previous lab and follow all the steps to ensure that the Instana server is
up and running.

:::

When installing Instana agent you have to select if you want the agent to be
**dynamic** or **static** based on whether it can update itself or not. Here is
the excerpt from the
[Instana agent documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/setup_and_manage/host_agent/index.html).

- A **Dynamic** host agent downloads the latest set of sensors from
  repositories. By default, a dynamic agent updates itself at agent startup and
  checks daily for updates to the agent and sensor code. This automatically
  gives you access to new features and bug fixes. It is also possible to tightly
  control the updating of dynamic host agents by
  [pinning a version](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-configuring-updates-dynamic-host#version-pinning)
  It is also possible to change the interval that the Agent checks for updates.

  By default, dynamic host agents use the Instana repository to pull updates,
  but it is possible to
  [set up your own managed mirror](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-setting-up-agent-repositories-dynamic-host).
  Currently, the mirror must be a Nexus or Artifactory repository. This is
  probably the best option for must customers because it allows them the
  benefits of automatic updates, while at the same time controlling the content
  that is in the repository. In addition, it eliminates the need for every Agent
  to have internet access to the repositories.

- A **Static** host agent is a self-contained host agent that includes all the
  latest available components at the time of its release, and has no dynamic
  update capabilities. The static host agent has a stable "bill of materials"
  that never changes after the host agent's installation. **Static Agents** must
  be manually upgraded or upgraded via automation such as Ansible.

:::tip

Static host agents require no internet connection to the Instana repository, and
are recommended in restrictive network setups.

## 4.2: Installing a local Instana Agent on K3s for self monitoring

Instana provides the ability to setup **self monitoring** of the **Standard
Edition** server. Self monitoring the Instana Backend when using the Standard
Edition of Instana installed on K3s is very simple. During the installation, the
Agent is automatically configured to monitor the key technologies such as
cassandra, kafka, postgres, etc. so that the entire Instana backend server is
being monitored.

Open a new terminal tab by selecting **File** -> **New Tab**.

SSH to the Instana server with the _stanctl_ cli tool installed:

```sh
ssh jammer@instana
```

Become the root user:

```sh
sudo su -
```

Run the following command:

```sh
stanctl agent apply
```

After a short time you should see the following output:

```sh
⠹ Applying instana-agent  [5s] ✓
```

---

## 4.3: Installing Instana Agent on a Linux VM

We will start by installing the Instana Agent on the Linux VM that is running
IBM MQ and ACE.

![architecture-agent-mqace-vm](images/architecture-agent-mqace-vm.png)

Open a new terminal tab by selecting **File** -> **New Tab**.

SSH to the ACE/MQ server as follows:

```sh
ssh jammer@mqace
```

When prompted if you want to continue connecting, type: `yes`

Use sudo to switch to the root user:

```sh
sudo -i
```

After logging into Instana for the first time you will be taken to the Agent
Deployment page.

:::tip

If you aren't on the **Agent deployment** screen you can get there by selecting
the **Home** menu in the left navigation and then clicking the **"Deploy
Agent"** button near the upper right corner.

![](images/deploy-agent.png)

:::

A list of different environments where you can install the Instana Agent is
shown. For example, on Linux, you can choose a automatic **one-liner**
installation, RPM, or TAR file installation. For OpenShift/kubernetes, you have
multiple options including operator, helm, and yaml installs. The easiest method
is the default, **"Automatic Installation (One-Liner)"**. The _MQACE_ VM is a
Linux server, so select Linux (One-liner).

![instana-default-login](images/agent-deployment.png)

There are a few other options including the use of different java versions,
static vs. dynamic agents, etc. Leave the default settings.

Next, select the checkbox next to **"Install and start as service"**. This will
setup the systemctl autostart process and will also start the Agent immediately
after it is installed.

![install command](images/install-command.png)

Finally, copy and paste the curl command into the **root@mqace** terminal window
and answer `y` when prompted.

At this point the Agent is installed and up and running. You can confirm this by
running:

```sh
ps -ef | grep instana
```

You should see a process running, the short version looks like this:

```sh
root       22012       1 99 12:35 ?        00:00:11 /opt/instana/agent/jvm/bin/java
```

The Agent will automatically start monitoring the operating system and start
discovering key processes and middleware. In many cases it will automatically
instrument those technologies. In the case of some technologies (eg. MQ an and
App Connect Enterprise), there are manual configuration steps required due to
the need to provide credentials for accessing those applications.

---

## 4.4: Installing Instana Agent on OpenShift Cluster

The next step is to install the Instana Agent into the **Apps** Sing Node
OpenShift Cluster that in future labs we'll be using to host our demo
applications _Robot Shop_ and _Quote of the Day_.

![architecture-agent-ocp](images/architecture-agent-ocp.png)

:::tip

Throughout this lab, we will be using the "oc" command to run commands within
OpenShift. The "oc" command is similar to kubectl for other versions of
Kubernetes. There are some minor syntax differences.

:::

**Open another tab in your terminal** so you are back on the local bastion host
**admin@bastion-gym-lan**.

Check to make sure you are in the right place by running the following:

```sh
cd ~
oc cluster-info --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps
```

You should see the following output, specifically the url
`https:api.sno.techzone.lan:6443`. If you don't try opening a new tab or
terminal window and trying again.

![check-cluster](images/check-cluster.png)

Follow the steps below to install the Agent into the cluster:

Set the correct cluster to use:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=~/kubeconfig-apps
```

Set permissions for the Instana Agent to allow the Agent to have access to
monitor the entire cluster:

```sh
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps
```

From the **Agent deployment** screen select OpenShift, Helm chart from the list.

:::tip

If you aren't on the **Agent deployment** screen you can get there by selecting
the **"Stan"** robot icon in the upper left corner and then clicking the
**"Deploy Agent"** button near the upper right corner.

![](images/deploy-agent.png)

:::

![](images/agent-deploy-ocp-helm.png)

Provide a meaningful name for the Cluster and specify and Agent Zone. These
namespace will show up within the Instana UI:

- **Cluster name**: `SNO`
- **Agent Zone**: `Demo Apps`

![](images/clusterZone.png)

Setting these values will allow you to find your Agent and Kubernetes Cluster
within the user interface and not get confused by data coming in from other
agents.

:::info

Zones are used to organize the Instana Agents (and sensors). Many customers
create zones for lines of business, data center locations, public cloud regions,
etc

:::

Copy the command from the Instana Web UI and run it as the admin user on the
bastion host.

:::note Copy & paste

Be mindful when copying and pasting to ensure no extra lines are inserted by
first copying the command to a text document.

:::

You will see output similar to what's shown below

![helm install](images/helm-install.png)

Next, view a list of the pods that are running in the agent namespace. There
will be one pod for each worker node in your target cluster. This SNO cluster
only has one worker node so you will only see one pod running.

```sh
oc get pods -n instana-agent --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps
```

![running agent pods](images/ocp-agent-running.png)

This completes the installation of Instana agent on OpenShift cluster.

---

## 4.5: Installing Instana Agent in a Docker Environment

:::warning Information Only

You do not need to perform the actions in this section. This is for your
information only. It may be useful if you install Instana using the Classic
mode.

:::

If you chose to run the Classic installation of Instana Server you might also
want to deploy an Instana Docker agent locally to self monitor the Instana
Backend.

![architecture-agent-mqace-vm](images/architecture-agent-instana-vm.png)

You can navigate back to your first tab still logged into the **instana** host
or from a terminal ssh to the Instana server again:

```sh
ssh jammer@instana
```

Switch to root

```sh
sudo -i
```

In the Instana UI, from the **Agent deployment** screen select **Docker** this
time.

:::tip

If you aren't on the **Agent deployment** screen you can get there by selecting
the **"Stan"** robot icon in the upper left corner and then clicking the
**"Deploy Agent"** button near the upper right corner.

![](images/deploy-agent.png)

:::

![](images/agent-deploy-docker.png)

At the top of the page you will see an entry box where you can specify a
**Zone**. Specify a zone name such as **TechZone**. Then, copy the docker run
command and paste it into the **root@instana** terminal window.

![](images/agent-deploy-docker-config.png)

This will install the Instana Agent as a docker container running on the Instana
Server machine.

Once complete you can issue a **docker ps** command, you'll see there is a new
Instana agent container running.

```sh
docker ps | grep agent
```

![docker ps agent](images/docker-ps-agent.png)

Once installed, the Agent will begin to collect host metrics and will discover
the various technologies like Cassandra, ClickHouse, ElasticSearch, Nginx,
Node.js, and more. Many of these technologies will be monitored automatically
without the need for configuration. In some cases, the sensors need to be
configured in order to see the performance metrics.

---

## 4.6: View Instana Agents in the Instana UI

From the left navigation select **Infrastructure**.

![](images/infrastructure-menu.png)

You should see 3 nodes reporting. The **Instana VM**, the **MQACE VM** and the
**Single Node OpenShift (SNO) VM**. If you don't see them yet, give the agents a
few minutes to start up.

:::note

In an upcoming section we will learn how to update the name of the zone where
the _MQACE_ VM resides.

:::

![](images/show-three-vms.png)

## 4.7: Troubleshooting Instana Agent Installation on Linux

If you cannot see the **Instana** or **MQACE** hosts in the Instana UI you
should read the Instana agent logs on the respective agent host located at
`/opt/instana/agent/data/log/agent.log`. Look for the current status and any
warnings or errors that may be shown.

## 4.8: Troubleshooting Instana Agent Installation on Kubernetes Cluster

If you don't see the **SNO host** in the **Demo Apps** zone after a couple of
minutes, you need to troubleshoot the Instana Agent.

:::caution Important

The following must be done from a terminal window on the bastion host
(**admin@bastion-gym-lan**)

:::

Check to make sure that all pods are running. Since Instana agent runs as a
DaemonSet the number of pods should be equal to number of nodes in your cluster,
in this case one.

```sh
oc get pods -n instana-agent --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps
```

You can check the Instana Agent pod logs by running:

```sh
oc logs $(oc get pods -n instana-agent -o custom-columns=POD:.metadata.name --no-headers --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps) -n instana-agent -c instana-agent --kubeconfig kubeconfig-apps
```

## 4.9: Configuring Proxy

:::warning Information Only

This section is here for informational purposes. There are no steps to execute.

:::

If there is no direct connectivity for the Instana agent you may need to setup a
proxy. There are 2 connections with 2 different locations for configuration:

- Connection to **Instana Backend** - defined in
  _INSTANA-AGENT-DIR_/etc/instana/com.instana.agent.main.sender.Backend.cfg
- Connection to **Agent/Sensor Repository** - defined in
  _INSTANA-AGENT-DIR_/etc/mvn-settings.xml (This is used in case client wants to
  setup internal maven2 mirror repository)

Proxy configuration goes into the respective files. You can also use
[environment variables](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-installing-docker#agent-configuration)

For backend connectivity you have to define **INSTANA_AGENT_PROXY\_\***
variables. For repository connectivity you have to define
**INSTANA_REPOSITORY_PROXY\_\*** variables.

## 4.10: Configuring Instana Agent

:::warning Information Only

This section is here for informational purposes. There are no steps to execute.

:::

There are multiple ways to configure the Instana agent. These instructions apply
to the Instana Agent installed on a traditional server. Instructions would be
different for docker or kubernetes versions of the Agent. Settings related to
agent functionality reside in `configuration.yaml` file located by default in
`/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana` directory. However, other settings related to
agent environment sits in other \*.cfg files.

:::info

Agent will actually read and use ANY yaml file in that directory.

:::

Some customers choose to have separate yaml files for each key technology. For
example, you could create a mq.yaml file and an ace.yaml file in the same
directory and it would read both files. `configuration.yaml` will contain sample
configuration entries and comments for ALL available sensors at the time of your
install, **BUT** it will not automatically add new sensor config as new sensors
become available.

For host based installation you can update `configuration.yaml` and agent should
pick up changes automatically (no restart required).

For Kubernetes based installations, you can specify the same content that would
go into the configuration.yaml file, but the mechanism is different. See the
product documentation for Operator and yaml based installations. For helm
installs, you use an **agent.configuration_yaml** parameter to reference a
values.yaml file. The configuration information would be placed in the
values.yaml file. Yaml content can be placed directly in the helm command, but
the syntax gets a little tricky. Here is an example helm command:

```sh
helm install instana-agent \
  --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
  --namespace instana-agent \
  --set agent.key=wxyz  \
  --set agent.downloadKey=abcdefg \
  --set agent.endpointHost=agent-acceptor.instana2.tivlab.raleigh.ibm.com  \
  --set agent.endpointPort=443 \
  --set zone.name=zone1 \
  --set cluster.name='cluster1' \
  --set agent.configuration_yaml="$(cat values.yaml)" \
  --set k8s_sensor.deployment.enabled=true \
  --set k8s_sensor.deployment.replicas=2 \
  instana-agent
```

:::info

Instana agent configuration file must be a proper YAML - if your changes are not
applied, make sure that it's not a formatting error

:::

## 4.11: Agent Configuration Troubleshooting

:::warning Information Only

This section is here for informational purposes. There are no steps to execute.

:::

The first place to look when the agent does not start properly or does not work
as expected is agent log file. By default it is located in
`/opt/instana/agent/data/log/agent.log` . This is the path for a traditional
server.

In case of Kubernetes based deployment you have to look at logs of
`instana-agent` pods running in `instana-agent` namespace.

---

## 4.12: Configuring GitOps for Agents

:::warning Information Only

This section is here for informational purposes. There are no steps to execute.

:::

If you don't want to modify the Instana agent configuration files for each agent
locally, you can setup a centralized git repository for configuration files and
instruct Instana agent to use these files. To accomplish that, follow the steps
from the
[documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-git-based-configuration-management).

The Instana agent fetches configuration updates from the remote repository:

1. Upon the startup or restart.
1. Through a reboot initiated over the Agent Management Dashboard.
1. Through a configuration change over the Agent Management Dashboard.
1. Through the Web API as described in the Host Agent section and the
   integrations that rely on it like the GitHub Update Agent action.
