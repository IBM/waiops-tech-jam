# Instana Server Installation

## 3.1: Introduction

Instana backend is available as SaaS (preferred option) or self hosted (aka
on-prem). For on-premises installations, Instana offers multiple containerized
options:

- **Standard Edition**
  - **Single-node cluster** Installs both the Instana backend and
    datastores on a single node K3s cluster.
  - **Multi-node cluster** Installs both the Instana backend and
    datastores a three node K3s cluster.
- **Custom Edition** Installs the backend Kubernetes Operator on a
  RedHat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster. The datastores are not installed by
  the operator, they require manual installation either locally on the same
  cluster or remotely.
- **Classic Edition** Install both the Instana backend and the
  datasotres on a single VM using Docker. Unlike the other options this
  deployment does not support multi-tenancy. Note: **Classic Edition** is not a
  strategic deployment option. Many recent enhancements such as synthetics,
  automation catalog, and more are not available with Classic Edition.

:::tip

On-premises (self-hosted) releases are delivered every 4 weeks. The release have
odd numbers such as 225, 227, 229, etc. Historically upgrading, you may upgrade
from N-1 or N-2, but you couldn't skip more than one release. So, you can
upgrade from 225 to 229, but not to 231. Even numbered releases are for SaaS
only. SaaS is upgraded every 2 weeks. With the most recent version of
**Self-Hosted Standard Edition**, the N-1/N-2 requirement doesn't exist. When
you upgrade Instana, you will be provided a list of available releases that can
be installed. However, we still recommend keeping your Instana version fairly
current. For example, plan for upgrades every 2 months.

:::

For the installation of the Instana server, we'll be following the instructions
from the Instana documentation for a **Self-Hosted Standard Edition Multi-node**. The
instructions can be found
[here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/290?topic=edition-installing)
for your reference, but you can follow the steps below. You will be performing
an online installation during this Tech Jam, but Instana does support off-line
(air-gapped) installs.

The Classic Edition and Standard Editions are Instana's smallest on-premises
installation option. Production and larger deployments are installed into
kubernetes for horizontal scale and resiliency. For this lab the installation of
Instana will be completed on the VM's named **instana-0**, **instana-1** and
**instana-2**.

## 3.2: Prerequisites

In multi-node clusters, only the production installation type is supported. The three nodes in a multi-node cluster have specific uses:

- The first node (instana-0), which is labeled as node-role.instana.io: "backend" during installation, is used for running backend workloads that require persistent volumes. The node also runs the gateway, acceptors, and the UI backend.
- The second node (instana-1), which is labeled as node-role.instana.io: "datastore" during installation, is used for running data stores.
- The third node (instana-2), which is labeled as node-role.instana.io: "other" during installation, is used for running the rest of Instana workloads.


For this installation, Instana requires 3 Linux servers with 12 cores and 48 GB of RAM each. 1.1TB of fast storage rated at at least 6000 IOPS (preferred 9000 IOPS) for production environments is also required. Several different versions of Linux are supported. We have chosen Ubuntu 22.04 for this environment.

:::tip

Demo deployments only require 3000 IOPS however multi-node deployments are not supported in demo mode.

:::

:::info

Normally, you would need to ensure that the virtual machine has the correct
ports opened in the firewall for the agent, UI, and EUM communications. We have
already done this work for you. For reference,
[here are the ports](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-system-requirements#networking-requirements)
that need to be opened for the Instana Server for an on-prem deployment. The
ports for SaaS are slightly different.

In addition, online installations need access to a number of repositories that
are documented here for reference:
[here are the ports](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=requirements-instana-self-hosted-deployments)

:::

:::tip

If you are unsure how to get access to the Bastion host (Guacamole) see
[Accessing a Lab Environment](/waiops-tech-jam/labs/jam-in-a-box/#accessing-a-lab-environment)

:::

From the Bastion host (Guacamole), open a terminal window by selecting
**Activities** at the top left of the screen and then the terminal icon.

![open-terminal](images/open-terminal.png)

Use the terminal to login to the Instana host:

```sh
ssh jammer@instana-0
```

When prompted if you want to continue connecting, type: `yes`

Use sudo to become root.

```sh
sudo -i
```

Prior to installing Instana, you must ensure there is no instance of Docker on
the machine you will use as it can
[conflict with K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/known-issues#snap-docker).

:::tip Optional Tip

Due to the large number of requests that can be made to Docker Hub from the IBM
network rate limiting may occur when you try to install Instana. You can prevent
this by adding your own Docker Hub credentials.

1. [Sign up](https://hub.docker.com/signup) to Docker Hub if you don't already
   have an account.
2. From the Instana VM export the following environment variables:

```sh
export DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=<your-docker-hub-username>
export DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD=<your-docker-hub-password>
```

3. Run the following commands to create the authentication file for Docker Hub
   in the K3s directory:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3s
sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml <<EOF
configs:
  registry-1.docker.io:
    auth:
      username: ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}
      password: ${DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD}
EOF"
```

4. Confirm the new file is accurate by running:

```sh
cat /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml
```

## 3.3. Preparing the server

There are few tasks that need to be run to prepare the servers for installation.

### 3.3.1. Prepare storage

| Node       | Directory           | Path                              | Required Disk (GB) |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| **instana-0** | Objects   | /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects      | 1000               |
| **instana-1** | Data      | /mnt/instana/stanctl/data         | 500                |
|            | Metrics    | /mnt/instana/stanctl/metrics      | 1000               |
|            | Analytics  | /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics    | 1200               |
| **instana-2** | No additional disk | N/A                               | 0                  |


### 3.3.2. Set the required kernel parameters

Set the required kernel parameters by running the following commands:

```sh
echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
echo vm.swappiness=0 >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-stanctl.conf
sysctl --load
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

Set the firewall rules. In this lab we are in a restricted network so we don't
need to worry about the firewall rules. You can simply run the following:

```sh
ufw disable
```

For production you can
[reference the Firewall Rules documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-preparing#firewall-rules)
for the exact rules you need to set for your Operating System.

Prepare the mount volumes. We will be using a single disk with multiple
directories in this lab. In a production environment you will likely want to
provision multiple disks to meet the
[IOPS requirements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-system-requirements#storage-requirements)
of Instana. If you use more than one disk you can refer to the
[documentaton for preparing additional disks](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-preparing#prepare-the-additional-disks)
for the Instana server.

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/data
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/metrics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics
mkdir -p /mnt/instana/stanctl/objects
```

You are now ready to start the installation of the Instana Server.

---

## 3.4. Installing Instana

Export the Download key as an environment variables. In the code block below,
replace `<your-download-key>` with the key provided for your lab environment.

```sh
export DOWNLOAD_KEY=<your-download-key>
```

Run the following commands to install the Instana package. Review the output of
each command using _cat_ to be sure the commands are successful before
proceeding to the next step.

```sh
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/instana-archive-keyring.gpg] https://artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/rel-debian-public-virtual generic main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/instana-product.list
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/instana-product.list
```

```sh
cat << EOF > /etc/apt/auth.conf
machine artifact-public.instana.io
  login _
  password $DOWNLOAD_KEY
EOF
cat /etc/apt/auth.conf
```

```sh
wget -O- --user=_ --password="$DOWNLOAD_KEY" https://artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/api/security/keypair/public/repositories/rel-debian-public-virtual | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/instana-archive-keyring.gpg
cat /usr/share/keyrings/instana-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Update the package list and install the Instana **stanctl** command. The
**stanctl** is used to install Instana and perform other administrative tasks.

```sh
apt update -y
apt install -y stanctl
```

Hold the stanctl package to prevent it from being upgraded unintentionally.

```sh
apt-mark hold stanctl
```

Install Instana

- We are installing Instana in **demo** mode.
- DNS has already been configured in this environment for the Instana vm, it can
  be reached at _instana.techzone.lan_. Further details on
  [required DNS entries can be found here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-preparing#dns-settings).
- Internally, Instana has tenants, which are merely a logical construct. Each
  tenant in turn has at least one or multiple tenant units. There are
  [restrictions to the names that can be chosen](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=cluster-preparing#tenant-and-unit-names).
  In this case the tenant is **ibm** and the unit is **unit0**.
- The default administrator password for the **admin.instana.local** user is
  **Passw0rd**.
- We are setting the volumes to the directories we created earlier.
- We are skipping preflight checks as the environment does not have the storage
  required to meet the minimum requirements, it is satisfactory for a small demo
  instance though.

  The installation below, uses a set of optional installation flags. If you are
  interested in seeing all of the available installation flags, you can type:

  ```sh
  stanctl up --help
  ```

Now, execute the installation command by copying and pasting the text from
below.

```sh
stanctl up \
--install-type="demo" \
--timeout="60m0s" \
--core-base-domain="instana.techzone.lan" \
--download-key=$DOWNLOAD_KEY \
--sales-key=$SALES_KEY \
--unit-tenant-name="ibm" \
--unit-unit-name="unit0" \
--unit-initial-admin-password="Passw0rd" \
--volume-analytics="/mnt/instana/stanctl/analytics" \
--volume-metrics="/mnt/instana/stanctl/metrics" \
--volume-objects="/mnt/instana/stanctl/objects" \
--volume-data="/mnt/instana/stanctl/data" \
--skip-preflight-check
```

The instana license is automatically applied during the installation process.
You can view it by running the following command:

```sh
stanctl license info
```

The installation will take approximately 20 minutes, but depends on the
performance of your server.

---

## 3.5: Launch the Instana User interface

Once the installation finished and you are prompted with the message....

You can open a browser and login to the Instana user interface.

Open a firefox browser and select the **Instana** bookmark.

![open firefox](images/open-firefox.png)

:::info

You can safely ignore the warning about the certificate being untrusted.

![untrusted-cert-advance](images/untrusted-cert-advance.png)

:::

When prompted, enter the username and password that you updated earlier.

- Username: **admin@instana.local**
- Password: **Passw0rd**

![](images/login.png)

You will be taken to an Initial Screen where you can install the instana agents
or navigate to the main product UI. We will install an Instana Agent in the
upcoming section of the lab.

---

## 3.6: Setting up SMTP

:::warning Do not perform these steps

You should not perform any steps in this section, it is for information only.

:::

You can configure SMTP settings when installing the cluster however as we have
already installed the Instana server, we can now make modifications to the
backend configuration using the stanctl tool.

```sh
stanctl backend apply \
  --core-smtp-from="server@instana.com" \
  --core-smtp-host="localhost" \
  --core-smtp-password="Passw0rd" \
  --core-smtp-port=25 \
  --core-smtp-start-tls=false \
  --core-smtp-use-ssl=false
```

You should see output similar to the below:

![backend-apply](images/smtp-backend-apply.png)

If you are interested in all of the parameters that can get specified using the
**stanctl backend apply** command, type:

```sh
stanctl backend apply --help
```

## 3.7: Turning on features

:::warning Do not perform these steps

You should not perform any steps in this section, it is for information only.

:::

There are optional configurations that you will likely want to make to your
installation of Instana.

These options are made available via optional 'feature flags'. For features such
as VMware/vSphere monitoring, Power HMC monitoring, and zHMC monitoring which
are disabled by default.

As an example to enable VMware/vSphere monitoring, you would run the following
command:

```sh
stanctl backend apply --core-feature-flags feature.vsphere.enabled
```

You can view a
[full list of available feature flags here.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=configuring-enabling-optional-features)

---

## 3.8: Upgrading the Instana server

:::warning Do not perform these steps

You should not perform any steps in this section, it is for information only.

:::

Upgrades are made simple with the **stanctl** tool. The process for an upgrade
is to first upgrade **stanctl** and then upgrade the Instana backend.

Upgrading the **stanctl** tool is different depending on the Operating System
you are using. As an example for Ubuntu you would run the following commands:

```sh
# Unhold the stanctl package if it is held
sudo apt-mark unhold stanctl

apt update -y
apt install -y stanctl

# Hold the stanctl package again to prevent it from being upgraded unintentionally.
apt-mark hold stanctl
```

Then upgrade the backend:

```sh
stanctl up
```

The command will list the available updates. Use the arrows on your keyboard to
move up and download to select the version that you want to install. For
example, move the arror to **Install Instana version: 3.287.582-0** and press
**Enter** to upgrade the backend.

---

## 3.9: Summary

In this portion of the lab, you have learned how to install the **Self-Hosted
Standard Edition** Instana server. For a POC, we recommend either SaaS or the
single server self-hosted docker installation of the Instana server. For
production deployments, customers will want the **multi-node Standard Edition**
or **Self-Hosted Custom Edition**. **Multi-Node Standard Edition** will increase
scalability. **Self-Hosted Custom Edition** provides more flexibility in terms
of kubernetes/OpenShift environments and dramatically improves scalability as
well as providing built-in resiliency.

You have also learned how to configure the SMTP settings and how to enable
feature flags.

Finally, you learned how to upgrade a docker based self-hosted Instana server.

You are now ready to learn how to install and configure an Instana Agent.
