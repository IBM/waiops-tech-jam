# Synthetic Monitoring

:::warning Work In Progress

This lab is currently under development.

:::

This lab focuses on new Instana features - synthetic monitoring.

Key capabilities that will be exercised are:

- Setting up the synthetic "Point of Presence" This is the component that
  executes the synthetic test.
- Single REST API synthetic test
- Using javascript to execute a scripted synthetic test that exercises multiple
  REST calls
- Setup Smart Alerts against synthetic tests

Before we can create any synthetic tests, we must first setup a synthetic "Point
of Presence" or "PoP server" to playback our synthetic tests. Many customers
deploy two or more "Points of Presence" so that they can compare the response
time and availability from different network zones. For example, if a PoP server
running in the LAN network performs well, but a PoP server located on a WAN
network is performing poorly, it is clear indication that the problem is the
network or load balancer rather than the application.

In the lab, we will begin by installing the "Synthetic Point of Presence".

## Enable backend feature "Synthetic Point of Presence"

We will be installing the Synthetic Point of Presence onto the same K3s cluster with Instana backend. In order to do that, we'll need a CLI with access to the K3s cluster.

From the student VM, open a terminal window and type:

```sh
ssh jammer@instana-0
```

the access to Instana cluster doesn't require password. When logged in change user to root to have configured environment with kubectl command:

```sh
sudo su -
```

Make sure you are logged into the K3s cluster by typing "kubectl get nodes". The command should result with a list of 3 nodes of the cluster.

A synthetic feature must be enabled in the Instana backend in order for you to play the synthetic tests. Follow the steps below to enable the synthetics feature within the Instana cluster. The feature is a backend functionality that allows to integrate one or many Synthetics Point Of Presence components placed in different locations into the same Instana Backend.

Enable synthetic feature of core component by command:
```bash
stanctl backend apply --core-feature-flags feature.synthetics.enabled=true
```

If asked, press ENTER to auto-generate TLS certificate.

Ensure synthetic pods have started successfully:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep synthetic
```

list of pods should include 5 components:
```text
instana-core      sli-synthetics-filter-6b4d4cc884-g9qfv          1/1     Running   0   45s
instana-core      synthetics-acceptor-6cfff7c567-b867k            1/1     Running   0   45s
instana-core      synthetics-health-processor-79d9998465-b8w5r    1/1     Running   0   45s
instana-core      synthetics-reader-65fb59499f-vq667              1/1     Running   0   45s
instana-core      synthetics-writer-6fbfc76b56-kpg4d              1/1     Running   0   44s
```

At this point, the Instana cluster is capable of displaying synthetic tests, but you still need to install the "Synthetic Point of Presence".

## Install "Synthetic Point Of Presence"

"Synthetic Point Of Presence" is a component that plays synthetic tests and reports result to Instana backend server

Install helm with command from instana-0 node:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

from top left corner of dashboard click Activities, select Firefox to open browser. Select Instana bookmark from bar.
Login to Instana.

by default username: `admin@instana.local`, password: `Passw0rd`

From the left menu select "Synthetic Monitoring" and then click on "Deploy a PoP" button on the right side:
![alt text](images/DeployAPoP.png)

Use **Simple** tab for Helm command.

You will need to edit the information contained in the helm command, so copy and paste the text into a temporary file where you can use an editor such as **vi** to edit the content.
![alt text](images/PoPCommand.png)

For Synthetic Point of Presence we need to modify some of the parameters and provide one additional parameter.  

- Set **namespace** for PoP on a new cluster, let's use "instana-synthetic".
- Modify the **controller.clusterName** parameter and provide a meaningful name, let's set i as "MyInstanaCluster".
- In the **controller.location**, specify a name, display name, country, etc. for your "Point of Presence".   The "0;0" parameter represents the longitude and latitude of the "Point of Presence".  These parameters help identify the Point of Presence when there multiples deployed. For example: "Local;on Instana cluster;Serbia;Belgrade;39.54;116.23;A test Synthetic Point of Presence".
- Enter a redis password.  This can be any value since you are setting the password. For example "a1fc5d01bcbb".
- ***If OpenShift versions 4.11 and above is used*** add `--set seccompDefault=true \`.  This parameter is **not** required for the lab as in our case seccompProfile is of DefaultRuntime type by default.

Execute the helm chart install command. You should see an output similar to the following:

```sh
root@instana-0:~# helm install synthetic-pop \
        --repo "https://agents.instana.io/helm" \
        --namespace instana-synthetic \
        --create-namespace \
        --set downloadKey="***" \
        --set controller.location="Local;on Instana cluster;Serbia;Belgrade;39.54;116.23;A test Synthetic Point of Presence" \
        --set controller.clusterName="MyInstanaCluster" \
        --set controller.instanaKey="t7g6RMBU12KpiPy2tW3Vox" \
        --set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint="https://instana-0.ibmdte.local/synthetics" \
        --set redis.tls.enabled=false \
        --set redis.password="a1fc5d01bcbb" \
        synthetic-pop
NAME: synthetic-pop
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Apr  6 17:53:51 2025
NAMESPACE: instana-synthetic
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
CHART NAME: synthetic-pop
CHART VERSION: 1.2.13
APP VERSION: 1.292.0
```

## Verify installation

After the Synthetic point of presence is installed verify its appearance in the interface:

![](images/PointOfPresence_Location.png)

You can also confirm that all pods of the Synthetic Point of Presence are running by typing:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n instana-synthetic
```

Confirm that the pods are all running.


## Certificate expiration check with Synthetic Tests
The functionality allows to establish certificate expiration check for websites. In the lab we will use a test application "Quote of the day" which is installed on VM demo-apps.

### SSL Certificate synthetic test
From the left menu select "Synthetic Monitoring", on "Tests" tab click "ADD":

![alt text](images/AddSynthetic.png)

choose "Add Synthetic Test".

On the top right corner of the dialogue click button **"Switch to advanced mode"**. Choose "SSL Certificate" and click "Select":

![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-select.png)

Specify the address of the test website "qotd.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local" and the number of days before certificate expiration when test will fail:

![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-hostname.png)

Scroll down to Locations section and choose "Select Location", put the checkmark next to "Local" and press "Add Location":

![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-location.png)

Select frequency of the SSL checks:

![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-frequency.png)

Give the test name and description:
![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-name.png)

When the website is part of Application or Website/Mobile App we can choose certain Application perspective, Website or Mobile application to associate the test with existing instance. In that case filtering events by selected perspective will provide relevant context including TLS certificate checks. In the end of the dialogue Custom Properties may be specified in order to differentiate project or particular certificate for notifications.

Click "Create".

Wait for up to one minute for the first check to have place. You may refresh the browser page to see the green icon "Health" of the test before automatic page refresh:

![alt text](images/SSL-certificate-health.png)

Click on the name of the test to investigate summary of the certificate check. If you see message "No results for this time frame", then change time frame for longer period, for example "last 30 minutes" and refresh the browser page.

## REST API Synthetic Tests
In the exercise we will follow creating a test of series of probes. 

### Simple REST API test

Let's begin by executing a simple REST API test. This will be a single REST GET
request.

Begin by selecting **Synthetics** and then **+ ADD** as seen below.

![alt text](images/AddSynthetic.png)

Then, choose the **Add Synthetic Test** button:

![alt text](images/addSynthetics2.png)

On the dialog that opens, you will see several options including **API Simple** test. Leave the default of **API Simple** and click the **Next** button:  

![alt text](images/addSynthetics3.png)

A new dialog will open prompting for the REST API **GET** URL.   Enter the following URL:
```sh
https://qotd.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local
```

This could be any REST request. In this case, we are testing the **Random** API
call within the **Quote of the Day** application.

Then, select your **Point of Presence** location and click **Next**. This allows
you to choose the location(s) where you want your synthetic script to execute.
In the lab, you only have 1 location that you can select.

![alt text](images/addSynthetics4.png)

The next screen allows you to specify the scheduling interval for your synthetic test. Drag the time slider to 1 minute. Then, select **Next**

![alt text](images/scheduling.png)

On the next screen you will give your synthetic test a name and description. 

![alt text](images/testName.png)

On the next step, you can associate the synthetic test with an application. In this lab we didn't create any Application Perspectives, we will skip the optional step.

Finally, click the **Create** button to finish creating your synthetic test.


At this point, you should see a synthetic test named **Random Quote**:

![alt text](images/randomQuote.png)

Click on the **Random Quote** link to drill down into the details of the
synthetic test.

It will take up to a minute for the synthetic tests to begin executing.

On the screen, you can see a summary of the synthetic results. You can also
click on the **Results** tab and see the detailed results of each synthetic
test.

![alt text](images/syntheticResults.png)

You have now created a synthetic test against a single REST API.  Next, we will be learning how to create more complex synthetics using javascript.  

The example we will be using will be executing against test JSON-server. That will be our next step.


### Creating a scripted REST API test

**Scripted REST API synthetic tests** may include several calls and different types GET/POST/PUT/DELETE in the same test. During the lab we will be doing two GET requests:
- First, we will check if "Quote of the day" application returns success code of **200**
- Next, the script will perform functional test by checking correct response from exact REST API request.

To create synthetic test open "Synthetic Monitoring" and click "+ ADD" button on the right bottom corner:

![](images/AddSynthetic.png)

Choose "Add Synthetic Test"

Select "Script API" and click "Next" button:

![alt text](images/SyntheticScript.png)

Paste the script into a field as shown below:

```javascript
var assert = require("assert")

// Address that Synthetic PoP will use to access target host to interrogate:
var SERVER_ADDR = 'http://qotd-api.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local';

// ======================================================================
// First call
// create Object option with details of request including URI and header:
var options = {
    uri: SERVER_ADDR+'/usecase',
    strictSSL: false,
    headers: {
                   'Content-type': 'application/json'
    }
};

// Send request and check if the response code is 200
$http.get(options, function (error, response, body) {
  var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body)
  assert.ok(
    response.statusCode == 200,
    "GET status should be 200. Instead it's " + response.statusCode,
  )
})

// ======================================================================
// Second call
// create Object option with details of request including URI and header:
var options = {
    uri: SERVER_ADDR+'/usecase',
    strictSSL: false,
    headers: {
                   'Content-type': 'application/json'
    }
};

// Send request and check if the response is "1_cascade_failure"
$http.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body);
    assert.ok(bodyObj[0].id == "1_cascade_failure", "First record value: " + bodyObj[0].id);
});
```

As follows:

![alt text](images/Create_Synthetic_Test.png)

Instana will run the script from previously installed Synthetic Point of
Presence, they can be placed at multiple locations across available
infrastructure. The one we will use is deployed on the same cluster with
Instana, it may have different name. Select it for our test.

Click Next

Adjust time slider to run test every minute:

![alt text](images/TimeSlider.png)

and click "Next" button.

Give the test meaningful name and description: ![](images/CreateSynthTest.png)

Give the test meaningful name and description:

![alt text](images/CreateSynthTest.png)

At the "Associate" step you may specify the list of existing application perspectives for which the test is relevant. The result of the test will appear at the "Synthetic Monitoring" tab of the Application dashboard and you will be able to filter tests by application on Synthetic Monitoring dashboard. We didn't create any Application Perspectives in the lab, so will skip the step.

Click "Create" button.

It may take up to minute for Instana to perform the first test and show the line
with results. You can refresh browser window and changing time duration for the
dashboard on right top of the window to speed up the line to appear before the
results of first test will be processed.

By now you should see a list of tests:

![alt text](images/ListOfTests.png)

Click on the test name to access the dashboard of the synthetic test, open "Results" tab and select one of the tests:

![alt text](images/SyntheticTestDashboard.png)

Next let's adjust threshold of the assert so that it fails.
In a new browser tab open address `http://qotd-api.apps.demo-apps.ibmdte.local/usecase` to see the reply JSON server returns to Instana:

![alt text](images/JSON-Server-db.png)

At the moment we're checking status of first record id "0", which returns value `1_cascade_failure`, let's check the second record, with the same value. As soon as server returns another value the test wil fail.
For that edit the synthetic test and adjust the assertion to check element "1": `assert.ok(bodyObj[1].id,` to cause the test to fail as shown below:

```javascript
...
$http.get(options, function(error, response, body) {
    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(body);
    assert.ok(bodyObj[1].id == "1_cascade_failure", "First record value: " + bodyObj[1].id);
});
```

To edit the existing test, click on the **Configuration** tab and then select
the **edit** pencil.

![alt text](images/editTest.png)

Next, click on **Configuration** and then **Edit Script**.  Alternatively you may need to scroll down slightly on the page.

![alt text](images/editScript.png)

You can now edit the javascript and change the assertion as below:

![alt text](images/editScript2.png)

When you have finished editing the javascript, click **Save** to save the
javascript and then **Save** again to save the synthetic test.

Click on the **Results** tab and then click the **Live** button to view the results of the synthetic tests as they become available.
Now, wait about a minute and you will see new test results that have a failure status:

![alt text](images/results.png)

Click on the failed tests and you will see text similar to the following:

![alt text](images/results-failed.png)

The test fails because we got second record `id` with value "1_cert_warning", while expected "1_cascade_failure" like with first record.

## Create smart Alert for test

Smart Alerts allow you to identify a threshold violation. Then, if desired,
Alert people via external systems like Watson AIOps or Email, Slack, Service
Now, etc. in Instana the notification mechanism is called an **Alert Channel**

Click "Synthetic Monitoring" -> "Add"

![alt text](images/AddSynthetic.png)

Then, select "Add Synthetic Smart Alert":

![alt text](images/AddSynthetics2.png)

Click "Add Synthetic Test"
![alt text](images/selectSyntheticTest.png)

Find the test you created earlier and select the **checkbox**. Then, click **Add
1 Test**

![alt text](images/selectTest.png)

Click **Next** to go to the next step of the dialog.

You may optionally add filters for monitored what is being monitored. In this case, we will not be adding any filters.

Click **Next** to go to step 3

We choose 1 consecutive occurrence to fire an alert, click **Next** to go to Step 4

In the next step, we will be selecting an Alert Channel. Alert Channels allow
you to notify people and teams various **channels** such as email, slack,
ServiceNow, etc.

Select **"Select Alert Channels"**, **"Create Alert Channel"** to create new channel, then populate name of the channel and the list of email addresses (we will not send emails to real addresses, so just populate the field with any email address):

![alt text](images/SA_Step4_CreateChannel.png)

Then, click "Create Alert Channel".

Select created channel and click "Add 1 Channel":

![alt text](images/SA_Step4_AddChannel.png)

And click "Next" to proceed to step 5.

Configure the alert that will be visible when the threshold violated. Set meaningful values for Title, Alert Level and Description, then click "Create" button:

![alt text](images/SA_Step5.png)

Refresh page to have the alert appeared:

![alt text](images/ConfiguredAlert.png)

Check Events appeared:

![alt text](images/Events.png)

When new Events trigger on the synthetic test, an e-mail will be sent out via
the **Alert Channel** notifying the people of the failure.

## Summary

During the lab we:

- Configured target monitored system (created Token to request parameters)
- Created a TLS certificate expiration check
- Created a simple synthetic test using a REST GET call.
- Created a complex synthetic test that uses javascript to exercise multiple
  REST calls and perform an evaluation.
- Created Smart Alert for a synthetic test
