# Lab Environment

The lab environment includes 5 VMs.

1. **Bastion VM** - A RHEL VM named `bastion-gym-lan` that will be used as the
   _bastion host_ for the lab network. This Bastion host has access to all lab
   VM's and will be your primary workstation for these labs.
2. **Instana VMs** - 3 Ubuntu VMs that are running a multi-node self-hosted
   Instana server on K3s.
3. **Demo Applications Cluster** - An Ubuntu VM running K3s, which has the Quote
   of the Day demo application running on it that will be the target for
   synthetic tests in this lab.
