In the Watson AIOps labs of the AIOps Jam-in-a-Box series you will be going
through several key exercises in order to learn more about the IBM Cloud Pak for
AIOps.

There are three Watson AIOps labs:

- [**Installation**](../install/1-introduction/index.md)
  - Install a small size deployment of the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOPs
  - Custom deployments sizes using the _custom sizing tool_
  - Storage requirements
  - Integration with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- [**Topology**](../topology/1-introduction/index.md)
  - Collecting topology data
  - Using rules to merge topology elements
  - Using templates to gather resources into logical groups
  - Define applications from groups and business criticality
- [**Alert Correlation**](../alert-correlation/1-introduction/index.md)
  - Load sample event and alert data using a generic webhook and kafka topic
  - Scope-based alert correlation
  - Temporal alert correlation
  - Topological alert correlation

More labs will be added in the future to explore more advanced scenarios and
features of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps.
