## 3.1: Overview

This module focuses on the initial deployment of the Cloud Pak for AIOps. 
This deployment scenario will assume you are deploying onto the IBM Technology Zone, 
[Jam-in-a-Box for AIOps](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/jam-in-a-box-for-aiops/environments) environments. 
Note that the same steps would generally apply to an OpenShift cluster deployed on
another cloud provider, or on-premises.



## 3.2: Connect to the OpenShift cluster from bastion VM

In the previous section, we described how to access the bastion VM. Now we will connect
to the OpenShift cluster:

* From the bastion VM desktop, open a **Terminal** window (you may need to click on **Activities** in the
top-left to remove the screen-saver)
* In the **Terminal** window, copy & paste the **oc** command below to login into the cluster. Get your 
**kubeadmin** password from your environment details page. This command will make a connection to your cluster 
and authenticate you, so you will be ready to start installing the product by issuing various commands against it.

```
oc login --server=https://api.ocp.techzone.lan:6443 --username kubeadmin --password <your password>
```



## 3.3: Install the Cloud Pak for AIOps Operator

In this section, our objective will be to deploy the product Operator which will
then pull down the software images to the cluster, so that we can deploy an instance
of the Cloud Pak for AIOps in the next section. You will be copying, pasting and
running the following commands from the **Terminal** window. 

:::tip
* It is essential to ensure the indentation is correctly copied from the documentation.
* When you copy the commands, use the Copy helper on the right side as shown below:

:::

:::caution
IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps and Infrastructure Automation can co-exist on the same cluster, but you cannot 
have multiple instances of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps or Infrastructure Automation on the same cluster.
:::

### Create a custom project (namespace)

Lets start by creating the project (namespace) where we will install the product. It is 
important to know which project/namespace you are in when issuing `oc`
commands. Run the following command:

```
oc create namespace cp4waiops
```

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_namespace).

### Create an OperatorGroup in your custom project (namespace)

The Operator requires an Operator Group, which provides multitenant configuration to
installed Operators. An Operator group selects target namespaces in which to generate 
required RBAC (Role Base Access Control) access for its member Operators. Run the following command:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: cp4waiops-operator-group
  namespace: cp4waiops
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - cp4waiops
EOF
```

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#op_group).

### Create the entitlement key pull secret

Now we will store the entitlement key that you obtained previously into a secret. This secret 
will be used to pull installation images. Copy & paste the following command into the **Text Editor** 
in the bastion VM, add your entitlement key and run the command from the **Terminal**: 

```
oc create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key \
    --docker-username=cp\
    --docker-password=<entitlement-key> \
    --docker-server=cp.icr.io \
    --namespace=cp4waiops
```


If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_pull_secret).

### Usage data collection

To help the development of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps, daily aggregated usage data is collected 
to analyze how the product is used. The usage data is collected by the cp4waiops-metricsprocessor pod, 
and is sent to and stored in IBM controlled GDPR-compliant systems. For the purpose of this Lab,
we will skip this step.

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#usage_secret).

### Ensure external traffic access

Run the following command to update the endpointPublishingStrategy.type. This is done to allow traffic 
in case the ingresscontroller its set to HostNetwork. Run the following command:

```
if [ $(oc get ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator -o jsonpath='{.status.endpointPublishingStrategy.type}') = "HostNetwork" ]; then oc patch namespace default --type=json -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/metadata/labels","value":{"network.openshift.io/policy-group":"ingress"}}]'; fi
```

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_ingress).

### Create the catalog source

After installation, the ibm-operator-catalog CatalogSource object determines whether the upgrade of 
your Cloud Pak for AIOps deployment is initiated automatically when a new patch becomes available.
The ibm-operator-catalog CatalogSource object can be configured to automatically poll for and retrieve 
a newer catalog by enabling the polling attribute, *spec.updateStrategy.registryPoll*. If a newer catalog 
for a patch is found and retrieved, then an automatic upgrade of your Cloud Pak for AIOps 
deployment is initiated. For the purpose of this Lab, we will disable the automatic initiation of patch upgrades.
Run the following two commands:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: ibm-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: ibm-operator-catalog
  publisher: IBM Content
  sourceType: grpc
  image: icr.io/cpopen/ibm-operator-catalog:latest
EOF
```

```
IMGDIGEST=`oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace -l=olm.catalogSource=ibm-operator-catalog --no-headers -o=jsonpath="{.items[0].status.containerStatuses[0].imageID}" -n openshift-marketplace` && \
oc patch catalogsource ibm-operator-catalog -n openshift-marketplace --type=json -p "[{ "op": "test", "path": "/spec/image", "value": "\"icr.io/cpopen/ibm-operator-catalog:latest\"" }, { "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image", "value": "\"$IMGDIGEST\"" }]"
```

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_catalog).

### Verify cluster readiness

In order to finish the Lab on time, we will skip the section regarding verifying the cluster readiness. 
Remember to run this verification in a production implementation.

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#prereq_check).

### Install the Cloud Pak for AIOps operator

Finally, we are ready to install the Operator. Run the following command:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
  namespace: cp4waiops
spec:
  channel: v4.1
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
  source: ibm-operator-catalog
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
```

Do not move to the next step until you can confirm that the Operator is fully installed
by running the verification command listed below. Verify that all of the components except 
**IBM Elastic**, have a state of **Succeeded**. As the **IBM Elastic** installation depends on the next step, 
you will see the **IBM Elastic** state as **Installing** or **Failed** but this is expected.

```
oc get csv -n cp4waiops | egrep "ibm-aiops-orchestrator|ibm-automation|ibm-common-service"
```

You should see three **Succeeded** messages as shown below:

![](images/3-succeeded.png)

If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_operator).



## 3.4: Deploy an instance of Cloud Pak for AIOps

This final step involves deploying a running instance of the product onto the OpenShift cluster.
Note in the following command that we specify **accept** the license, that the installation
size is **small**, and the name of the file and block **storage classes**. In a real deployment,
you will have to define the storage classes in advance. We will get deeper into storage classes later
in the Lab. 

Note also that we specify the **TopologyModel**. This is the terminology to use in the product when defining 
collections of topology resource groups. Valid values for TopologyModel are "application" or "service". 
Run the following command:

```
export LICENSE_ACCEPT=true
export INSTALL_SIZE=small
export STORAGE_CLASS_FILE=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
export STORAGE_CLASS_BLOCK=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
export TOPOLOGY_MODEL=application

cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: orchestrator.aiops.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: ibm-cp-watson-aiops
  namespace: cp4waiops
spec:
  imagePullSecret: ibm-entitlement-key
  license:
    accept: ${LICENSE_ACCEPT}
  pakModules:
  - name: aiopsFoundation
    enabled: true
  - name: applicationManager
    enabled: true
  - name: aiManager
    enabled: true
  - name: connection
    enabled: false
  size: ${INSTALL_SIZE}
  storageClass: ${STORAGE_CLASS_FILE}
  storageClassLargeBlock: ${STORAGE_CLASS_BLOCK}
  topologyModel: ${TOPOLOGY_MODEL}
EOF
```

Run the following command to check that the PHASE of your installation is **Updating**:

```
oc get installations.orchestrator.aiops.ibm.com -n cp4waiops
```

It takes around 60-90 minutes for the installation to complete (subject to the speed with which images can be pulled). 
When installation is complete and successful, the PHASE of your installation changes to **Running**. 

:::tip
While you wait for the installation to finish, complete the following Lab sections below and come 
back when you are done.
* Custom Sizing Tool
* Storage, HA and FIPS Considerations
:::



If your installation phase does not change to **Running** after 60-90 minutes, use the following command to find out which components are not ready:

```
oc get installation.orchestrator.aiops.ibm.com -o yaml | grep 'Not Ready'
```


If interested, this install step is documented [***here***](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=aiops-starter-installation#exp_instance).




## 3.5: Log in to the Cloud Pak for AIOps console

Now you are going to locate the console URL and the admin login credentials from your newly deployed
instance of the Cloud Pak for AIOps. 

Find the URL to access the console with the following command:

```
echo -e "https://$(oc get route -n cp4waiops cpd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')\n"
```

Find the password for the **admin** username by running the following command:

```
oc -n ibm-common-services get secret platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' | base64 -d ; echo -e "\n"

```

Open a Firefox browser window and copy & paste the **Cloud Pak for AIOps URL** that you got in the previous step. 
Note that you will get one or more security **Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead**. This is because we have used 
self-signed certificates for this Lab. Just accept the risk and continue. Make sure you can login as **admin**, 
as shown below, using the password from the previous command.

![](images/login.png)

:::tip
After confirming you can login as **admin**, complete the final Lab section:
* LDAP Integration
:::
