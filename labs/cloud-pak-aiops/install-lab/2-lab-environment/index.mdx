In this Lab, you will have access to one OpenShift cluster via a bastion virtual
machine that has installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Note that inside
OpenShift, the cluster has installed a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) server called OpenLDAP that will be used later in the lab. It also has
installed the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) which is a
software-defined, container-native storage solution that provides storage
classes that will be used by the Cloud Pak for AIOps to dynamically request
storage.

The following diagram describes the initial infrastructure for the Lab:

:::note

One key objective of this Lab is to expose the product public documentation to
the practitioners. With this in mind, each installation steps will reference the
product documentation.
