Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Install Lab. You will be going through several key exercises that will help you learn 
key skills around how to plan and install this product.


### Lab Content

In this Lab, we will explore the following topics:

* How to install a small size deployment of the Cloud Pak for AIOps
* How to custom size deployments based on actual workloads and functionality needs using the "custom sizing tool"
* An overview of Storage requirements, support for High Availability and FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) considerations
* How to configure the integration with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)


The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.
