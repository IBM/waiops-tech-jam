Runbook Automation (RBA) is a powerful ecosystem in AIOps that enables SMEs to author resolutions to common issues which can then be executed manually or autonomously against the incoming alerts. RBA supports a number of features including conditional branching and the passing of action output as parameters into subsequent steps. Both of these features will be included in the runbook we construct in this lab.

### Lab Content

In this lab, we will explore the following topics:

- Create an SSH integration with a target host Linux machine
- Create two automated actions to be used in our example runbook
- Create an example runbook that incorporates the two actions
- Create an AIOps runbook policy to link the runbook to incoming alerts
- Inject a sample alert and test the runbook

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections depend on work completed in prior sections.
