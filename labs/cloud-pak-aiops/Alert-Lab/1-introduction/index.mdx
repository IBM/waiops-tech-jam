Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Alert Correlation Lab. You will be going through several 
key exercises that will help you learn key skills around how events can get deduplicated and alerts correlated in
order to reduce noise and focus on the most relevant incidents.



### Lab Content

In this Lab, we will focus on different capabilities that help IT Operations personnel 
with event and alert noise reduction:

* Event and alert terminology
* How to load sample event and alert data using a generic webhook and kafka topic
* Scope-based alert correlation
* Temporal alert correlation
* Topological alert correlation

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation 
pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.
