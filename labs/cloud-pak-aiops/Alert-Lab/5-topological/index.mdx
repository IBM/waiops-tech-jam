This AI algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups alerts based on the 
resource groups in which those alerts occur. For example if you have a resource group 
made up of all the resources within a given Kubernetes namespace, then any alerts on pods, 
microservices, or other resources in that namespace will be grouped together 
in a single topological alert group.

Topological alert grouping helps you understand when alerts are connected based on their topology, 
providing valuable context information for why related alerts might occur together.
This algorithm is enabled by default so when related alerts are grouped based on their topology, Site Reliability Engineers 
(SREs) and other users responsible for application and service availability will be able to 
view the details of the alert in the context of the topology resources that are impacted.



## 5.1: Validate the Absence of Correlation

First, we will load a set of events to validate that there is no correlation whatsoever for the 
alerts created from these events. 

Create a new local file, name it *topology-events.json* and paste the following content into it:

```
{ "sender":{ "service":"Zabbix Middleware Monitoring", "name":"US-SOUTH CEA SelfMonitoring @AGG_P", "type":"Zabbix" }, "resource":{ "name":"computer1000", "hostname":"computer1000.company.com", "type":"host", "ipaddress":"10.1.96.24", "location":"US-SOUTH" }, "type":{ "classification":"System status", "eventType":"problem" }, "severity":3, "summary":"CPU at 80% utilization", "occurrenceTime":"2023-05-05T14:40:38.000Z", "expirySeconds":0 }
{ "sender":{ "service":"Zabbix Middleware Monitoring", "name":"US-SOUTH CEA SelfMonitoring @AGG_P", "type":"Zabbix" }, "resource":{ "name":"router1", "hostname":"", "type":"device", "ipaddress":"10.1.96.28", "location":"US-SOUTH" }, "type":{ "classification":"System status", "eventType":"problem" }, "severity":5, "summary":"Unscheduled device restart. Review log files", "occurrenceTime":"2023-05-05T14:45:20.000Z", "expirySeconds":0 }
{ "sender":{ "service":"Zabbix Middleware Monitoring", "name":"US-SOUTH CEA SelfMonitoring @AGG_P", "type":"Zabbix" }, "resource":{ "name":"greatfirewallofsecurity", "hostname":"", "type":"device", "ipaddress":"10.1.96.29", "location":"US-SOUTH" }, "type":{ "classification":"System status", "eventType":"problem" }, "severity":6, "summary":"Unable to load firewall rules after reboot", "occurrenceTime":"2023-05-05T14:46:10.000Z", "expirySeconds":0 }
```

Now lets submit the events via the webhook script created in the previous section by running the following command:

```
bash event-load-webhook.sh topology-events.json
```

* From the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Operate → Incidents and alerts**.
* From the **Incidents and alerts** page, click on the **Alerts** tab. 

Now we can see that the three alerts are independent from each other and not correlated. Also,
if you click on the **View correlation** icon in the top-right, the **Correlation** column shows
no correlation information for these alerts.

Lets clear these alerts before we create topology resources and test the topological correlation.
Select all the alerts, right-click and select **Clear**. Lets move to the next step in the Lab, 
the alerts will disappear after 2-3 minutes


## 5.2: Creating Topology Resources

As we have discussed before, topological alert correlation requires the definition of 
topology groups and to create these groups, first we need to create topology resources.

In a real-world scenario, it is likely that you would be using a number of
off-the-shelf Topology Observers to get your topology data from your environment. It is
also likely that you would also leverage the File or REST Observers
either to ingest data for which an off-the-shelf Observer doesn't exist, or to
manually create relationships between Resources in your topology for which there
is no source. 

In this scenario, we will have one set of topology data that represents
**physical infrastructure** and we will load this topology using a File Observer.

Create a file called **infrastructure.txt** with the following content:

```txt title="infrastructure.txt"
V:{"_operation":"InsertReplace","uniqueId":"379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e","matchTokens":["379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e","router1"],"tags":["WAIOpsDemo"],"name":"router1","entityTypes":["router"]}

```

#### File Observer Format Overview

The pseudo JSON format in this file is the format expected by the File Observer, and contains
topology directives, one per line. A line that begins with a **V** represents a
"Vertex" (or Resource). A line that begins with an **E** represents
an "Edge" (or Relationship).

:::note
Other format information can be found in the [**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.7.1?topic=jobs-file-observer)
:::


Log into the Cloud Pak for AIOps: 
* from the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Define → Data and tool connections**
* from the **Data and tool connections** page, click on **Add connection**
* from the **Add connections** page, under Category click on **Topology** then click on the **File** tile and click **Connect**


In the **New observer job: File** form, fill the Unique ID field as "infrastructure". Keep the 
**File Mode** as **Upload local file** and upload the **infrastructure.txt** file that you created in the previous 
step. Click the **Save** button.

![](images/infrajob.png)

:::note
The Provider will be automatically populated when you click Save.
:::

The File Observer job will run the moment it is saved. After you have done this, your
Observer jobs screen should look like the one below. You can verify that your job ran successfully by confirming the **Ready** status
for each job:

## 5.3: Creating a Topology Resource Group

Now that we have topology resources, we will create a topology group
using the "exact" topology group template. This template is useful for when you have a specific
collection of resources that are unique in your environment that may be of
particular importance. Perhaps you want to be able to find this group of
resources quickly and easily, or visualize them on the screen.


* From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.
* In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource group templates** icon in the top-right.
* In the **Resource group templates** page, click on **Create a new template**, select **Exact template** and click **Start**.

You will be presented with a **Template builder** page. From here, use the
following steps to configure a new exact template:

- Give the template a name such as "My Resource Group".
- Skip the optional **Description**.
- Choose the **Resource group type: network**
- Add a **Resource group naming pattern prefix** for the resulting group's name:
  **ROUTER-**
- Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template**. This is actually the objective of this Lab section after all! 
- In the **Search for a resource to get started** on the right, type **router1**
  and hit Enter
- Choose **router1** from the list of resources
- On the top-right, change the view to 1 hop and click **Render**

We have selected 3 resources that will be part of a group, as render in the view. Your form should look like this:

![](images/exact.png)

- Finally, click **Save template & generate resource group**

Click on **Resource group templates** in the top-left. In the **Resource group templates** screen, you will see your
new template:


![](images/resourcegroup.png)


Click on **Resource management** in the top-left and click on the **Resource groups** tab:

![](images/new-resource-group.png)

If you click on the name **ROUTER-router1**, you will be able to view the
topology group, which consists of 3 resources:

![](images/router1.png)



## 5.4: Validate Topological Correlation

Now we have a group of topology resources that can we use to validate topological 
correlation. We will reload the same events to confirm that alerts that impact
topology resources in the same group are actually correlated.

Lets submit again the events via the webhook script created in the previous section by running the following command:

```
bash event-load-webhook.sh topology-events.json
```

* From the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Operate → Incidents and alerts**.
* From the **Incidents and alerts** page, click on the **Alerts** tab. 

Now we can see that the three alerts have been correlated under a single group. Also,
if you click on the **View correlation** icon in the top-right, the **Correlation** column shows
the topological group icon. 

![](images/alerts-correlated.png)


Lets verify how the alerts are shown in the topology view:

* From the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.
* From the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource groups** tab. 

Now we can see the three alerts in the **Resource alerts** column, as shown below: 

![](images/group-with-alerts1.png)

Click on the resource group **ROUTER-router1** to see the resource details. Now we can see the
three resources, each with one alert. Click on the **Topology activity** on the bottom to show the
alert severity breakdown over time.
