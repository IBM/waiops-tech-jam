In this Lab, you will have access to one OpenShift cluster via a bastion virtual machine that has installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Note
that inside OpenShift, the cluster has installed the Cloud Pak for AIOps. It also has installed the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) which 
is a software-defined, container-native storage solution that provides storage classes that will be used 
by the Cloud Pak for AIOps to dynamically request storage. 

The following diagram describes the initial infrastructure for the Lab:
