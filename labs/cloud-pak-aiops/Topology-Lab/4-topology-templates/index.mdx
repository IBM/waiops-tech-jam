This chapter focuses on topology group templates, the different types, and what
each is used for, including for topology-based event correlation. We will use on 
the topology we created in the previous chapters.

By the end of this chapter, you will understand the four types of topology
templates, and have created an example of each type. You will also understand
what a "favorite" is and will have added some items to your topology dashboard.

Topology group templates are used to create groups of resources. Resource groups
make it easier to find and visualize collections of related resources, as well
as do event correlation over resources in a group. There are three main types of
topology group template:

- **Exact**: defines a single group of specific resources
- **Tag-based**: defines a single group of resources that share a common tags
- **Dynamic**: defines one or more groups of resources that match a prescribed specification
- **Token**: defines a set of rules which use the properties of your resources to create one or more groups which contain those resources


Note that **Exact** and **Tag-based** templates creates a **single** resource group while 
**Dynamic** and **Token** templates could create **multiple** resource groups.


## 4.1: Exact Group Template

An exact template builds a single group of resources centered on a specified seed 
resource. The membership of the resulting resource group includes the seed resource 
and those matching the specified relationship and/or resource type criteria. Resource 
group membership is dynamically maintained for the resulting resource group provided 
the specified seed resource type remains unchanged.

For example, you can use an exact template to create a group of resources only for a 
specific Jenkins build pipeline and any new builds or physical server and its 
connected network switch.

The exact topology group template is useful for when you have a specific
collection of resources that are unique in your environment that may be of
particular importance. Perhaps you want to be able to find this group of
resources quickly and easily, or visualize them on a wall screen.

#### Exercise

In this exercise, we will create a template for a specific group of resources
for our router (router1) and its connected resources.

From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate â†’ Resource management**.
In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource group templates** icon in the top-right.

In the **Resource group templates** page, click on **Create a new template**, select **Exact template** and click **Start**.

You will be presented with a **Template builder** page. From here, use the
following steps to configure a new exact template:

- Give the template a name and provide a brief description
- Choose the **Resource group type: network**
- Add a **Resource group naming pattern prefix** for the resulting group's name:
  **ROUTER-**
- Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template** 
  to correlate events across these resources
- Type **router1** in the search box: **Search for a resource to get started**
  and hit Enter
- Choose **router1** from the list of resources
- Change the view to 1 hop and click **Render**
- Click **Save template & generate resource group**

You should have something like the following:

![](images/exact.png)

After returning to the **Resource group templates** screen, you will see your
saved template:

![](images/resourcegroup.png)

:::note

An exact topology group template will only ever have 1 resource group.

:::

If you navigate to Resource management and search for **ROUTER-** , you will see
the following under the **Resource groups** tab:

![](images/search.png)

If you click on the name **ROUTER-router1**, you will be able to view the
topology group, which consists of 3 resources:

![](images/router1.png)

:::note

If you have enabled event correlation across this group of resources and receive
events related to any of these resources, these events will be correlated automatically.
This is called **topological correlation** and is one of the correlation modes in addition 
to **temporal** and **scope-based** correlation.

## 4.2: Tag Group Template

A tag based template builds a single but dynamic resource group containing resources 
that have the specified tag(s). Resource group membership is dynamically maintained 
to reflect changes in the topology for resources that gain or lose the specified tags.

For example, you can use a tag based template to create a dynamic group of your 
resources tagged with both 'red' and 'green'. Then, when you add new resources with 
both of those tags, the resource group will be updated to include them.

Note that resources don't have to be connected; they simply need to have
the common tag in order to be grouped. Tags can be added to resources via the
topology **tagsRule** as discussed in the previous chapter, or via the tags parameter 
if creating topology via the File or REST Observers.

#### Exercise

In this exercise, we will create a template for group of resources based on
their common tag.

In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource group templates** icon in the top-right.
In the **Resource group templates** page, click on **Create a new template**, select **Tag based template** and click **Start**.

You will be presented with a **Template builder** page. From here, use the
following steps to configure an tag based template:

- Give the template a name and provide a brief description
- Choose the **Resource group type: compute**
- Add a **Resource group name** for the name of the group of resources:
  **WAIOpsDemoAssets**
- Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template**
  to correlate events across these resources
- Type **WAIOpsDemo** in the search box: **Search for a tag to get started** and
  hit Enter
- Check **WAIOpsDemo** from the list of available tags and then click the
  **Resources** tab to see the list of matching resources
- Click **Save template & generate resource group**

You should have something like the following:

![](images/tagbased.png)

After returning to the **Resource group templates** screen, you will see your
saved template:

![](images/tagbasedsearch.png)

If you navigate to Resource management and search for **WAIOpsDemoAssets** , you
will see the following under the **Resource groups** tab:

![](images/tagresourcegrp.png)

If you click on the name **WAIOpsDemoAssets** , you will be able to view the
topology group, which consists of 8 resources:

![](images/tagrouter.png)







## 4.3: Dynamic Group Template

A dynamic template builds multiple groups of resources that are similar to the 
specified seed resource and relationship and/or resource type criteria. Resource 
group creation and membership is dynamically maintained based on the available 
topology data and how it changes.

For example, you can use a dynamic template to create dynamic groups of resources, 
one for each of your virtual machines and the Kubernetes services they're running. 
Resource groups are then added, removed and updated as you add or remove virtual 
machines and/or services running on them.


The Dynamic template is probably the most versatile of the three topology group
templates. Using an example of a set of resources you want to group, the dynamic
topology group template will automatically find other groups of resources that
follow the same "recipe" as the example you give. As you expose the resources
and relationships in the view, the template builder records the steps, and then
uses this recipe to find other similar groups of resources.


#### Exercise

In this exercise, we will create a dynamic template to create groups of servers
that host our applications. We will create a second server **computer1001** that
hosts the **notification** and **email** applications for the purposes of this
exercise.

Create a new file called application2.txt with the following contents:

```sh title="application2.txt"
V:{"_operation":"InsertReplace","uniqueId":"111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2","matchTokens":["111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2","notifications"],"tags":["WAIOpsDemo"],"name":"notifications","entityTypes":["application"]}
V:{"_operation":"InsertReplace","uniqueId":"111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2","matchTokens":["111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2","email"],"tags":["WAIOpsDemo"],"name":"email","entityTypes":["application"]}
V:{"_operation":"InsertReplace","uniqueId":"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2","matchTokens":["111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2","computer1001"],"tags":["WAIOpsDemo"],"name":"computer1001","entityTypes":["computer"]}
E:{"_toUniqueId":"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2","_edgeType":"runsOn","_fromUniqueId":"111-379177a8-0a6a-4068-817c-d6d6e870437e-app2"}
E:{"_toUniqueId":"111-974d1788-1312-4151-8a62-73fa1854e807-app2","_edgeType":"runsOn","_fromUniqueId":"111-9c1f90e0-7dc4-40d8-8721-40ea2f3af453-app2"}
```

Use the steps described in the previous chapter to import this file using a 
new File Observer job to ingest the topology data.

In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource group templates** icon in the top-right.
In the **Resource group templates** page, click on **Create a new template**, select **Dynamic template** and click **Start**.


You will be presented with a **Template builder** page. From here, use the
following steps to configure a dynamic template:

- Give the template a name and provide a brief description
- Choose the **Resource group type: compute**
- Add a **Resource group naming pattern** prefix for the resulting group's name:
  **APPSERVER-**
- Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template**
  to correlate events across these resources
- Type **computer1000** in the search box: **Search for a resource to get
  started** and hit Enter
- Choose **computer1000** from the list of available resources
- Right-click on computer1000 and select **Follow Relationship â†’ runsOn** which
  will expose the applications **webserver** and **billing**

You should have something like the following:

![](images/dynamic.png)

Continue with the following steps:

- Scroll down on the left side and note that the template has been recording
  your actions to build a "recipe" for the template
- Add a tag to the list of starting seeds if you want to restrict the items
  matched by this template to just those tagged with specific tags
- Continue to scroll down and click **Save template & generate resource group**

![](images/dynamic_def.png)

You should see that the dynamic template builder has found two groups of
resources that match the specification:

## 4.4: Token Group Template

A token template builds multiple groups of resources using one or more rules. Any resource
that matches one of the rules will be added to a group whose name is based on the 
rule's token. Resource group membership is dynamically maintained to reflect changes
in the topology for resources that match one of the template's rules.

For example, you could create a token template containing a rule with a token of
'applicationId'. When you next load data, if you have three resources which each
have an applicationId property value of 'MyApp', then a group called 'MyApp' will
be created, and those three resources will be added to it.

As token templates apply rules only to resources that are received via observer jobs, the
only way to actually see the new resource groups created by this template is by running 
the related Observer Jobs.

#### Exercise

We will create a Token group template to group cpu resources based on the manufacturer.
In other words, the template will create one group of all Intel cpu resources and 
another group of all AMD cpu resources.

In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource group templates** icon in the top-right.
In the **Resource group templates** page, click on **Create a new template**, select **Token template** and click **Start**.


You will be presented with a **Template builder** page. From here, use the
following steps to configure a token template:

- Give the template a name and provide a brief description
- Choose the **Resource group type: compute**
- Enable **Correlate event groups on topologies from this template**
to correlate events across these resources
- On the right side, set the Rule name as **CPU rule**
- For **Tokens** we will use **${name}** which is the value of the name property
which in our example will be Intel or AMD.
- Expand the **Conditions** section
- For **Observers** select **File** 
- Skip **Providers** as this will apply to all File Observer providers
- For **Resource types** select **cpu**. This is important as we only want to group
cpu type resources and nothing else. 
- Skip the **Token filter mode** as we don't need additional logic to filter.
- Click on **Save rule**.

- Now confirm that you see the new rule under **Rule definitions** as shown below
and click on **Save template**.

Finally, as this template will create new groups based on the cpu name and these 
resources are in the **infrastructure** resource data file, rerun the **infrastructure** 
observer job to actually apply the rules in this template.


Now in the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resource groups** tab and
you should see two new resource groups created as shown below:
