Topology Rules help streamline topologies and conserve system resources, such as by merging 
different observer records of the same resource into a single composite resource, or by excluding 
specific changes from being recorded against a resource history. You can use a number of different 
types of rules for different purposes.

:::note
In this Lab, we will only see a hands-on example of a **mergeRule**. Additional information about rules
cane be found in the product [**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=elements-configuring-rules).
:::

#### mergeRule

Different observers can record and then display the same resource as two (or more) resources. 
To prevent this, you can create a merge rule to ensure that the separate records of the same 
resource share values in their tokens set, which then triggers the Merge service to create a 
single composite resource vertex. Composite (or merged) resources are displayed in the Topology 
viewer as a single resource, which includes the properties of all merged resources. 
Merge rules are applied to resources in an observer job *before* it is sent to the topology service.


#### tagsRule

The tags rule allows the value of another field to be copied to the tags field so that it becomes 
searchable in the UI. It populates the tags of resources matched by the rule. Any field that is not 
indexed and cannot normally be searched becomes searchable when copied to the tags property. For a list 
of indexed properties, see [Properties](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=reference-properties).
Having the right tags in resources also enable the use of Tag Templates to group resources with a common
tag. We will see resource grouping in the next chapter. 

#### matchTokensRule

A match token rule allows the value of another field to be copied to the matchTokens field so that 
it can be used to match events to resources. It populates the matchTokens of resources matched by the rule.
This is really important as events get assigned to the impacted resource.

#### historyRule

A history rule identifies properties that change every observation, but that don't indicate an important change,
for example a host's sysUpTime property. Use a history rule to exclude properties from being retained 
in history, saving resources by not maintaining detailed historical records of changes to these properties.




## 3.1: Merge Rules in Action

You are now ready to create a Merge Rule to tie the two topology segments that we loaded in the previous 
chapter.

This is where the topology data coming from the application topology
source is mapped onto the topology data coming from the infrastructure
orchestration topology source. In our hypothetical scenario, we know we have
Resources of type "computer" in both sets of topology, and we know that they
relate to the same servers. Corresponding instances across the two data sets are
also labelled consistently and correctly, meaning that identifying the same
Resource across the two data sets is possible.

In our case, we have a Resource called "computer1000" represented in our
infrastructure topology data as well as in our application data. Our goal is to
merge the two sets of topology together so that we can both visualize what
applications are running on our servers, and more importantly, correlate
hardware alarms with application alarms, something that is not possible
otherwise. Note that the rule is created in a generic way so that if there were
any other computers included in our two data sets, they too would be merged
together automatically, so long as they met the criteria set out in the rule.


From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.
In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top-right and select 
**Topology configuration**. From the **Topology configuration** page, in the **Rules** card, select **Configure**. 

Select the **Merge rules** tab and click the **New** button in the top-right.

Follow these steps to create your new Merge Rule:

- **Rule name:** Give your rule a name, for example **InfrastructureApplications**

- Set **Status** to **Enabled**

- **Tokens**: The tokens refer to the parameters in your Resources that will be
  compared. In our case, the parameter that stores the computer name is called
  "name" in both sets of data, therefore we just need one token entry here called
  **name**. If the parameters were named different things, you could
  simply add both of the parameter names here.

- Expand the **Conditions** drop-down.

- **Observers**: Add **File** to the list of Observers this rule should apply
  to. Since both job types are of type File, this is all that is needed in this
  case. Normally you would add all the Observer types that apply to your
  mapping. If this section was left empty, it would try to apply this rule to
  topology data coming from **all** Observer types.

- **Providers**: Add both of your jobs to the list (e.g. 
  **FILE.OBSERVER:infrastructure.txt** and **FILE.OBSERVER:application.txt**)
  This specifies that this rule should only apply to these particular jobs. If
  this section was left empty, it would try to apply this rule to topology data
  coming from **all** File jobs defined.

- **Resource types**: Add the Resource types that this rule should apply to -
  ie. **computer**. If this section was left empty, it would try to apply this
  rule to **all** Resource types in the Observers list and Providers list above.

- The **Token filter mode** and **Token** filters sections allow you to refine
  your rule mapping even further, by allowing you to specify regular expressions
  to either include or exclude the set of Resources from the rule. In this case,
  we will leave both of these sections blank.

:::note
It is good practice to specify an appropriate set of Conditions for your rules,
to ensure they only get applied to things they're meant to.
:::

When finished creating your new Merge Rule, click **Save** and return to the
Observer jobs page

* from the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Define → Data and tool connections**
* from the **Data and tool connections** page click on **Add connection**
* from the **Add connections** page click on **Topology** and select **configure, schedule, and manage other observer jobs **

Click on the Run (Play button icon) to run your two jobs again. The data will be
reprocessed in light of the new Merge rule information, and any Resources that match
the rule will have the merge operation applied against them.

:::info

The merge will not happen unless the affected jobs are re-run. In other words,
you will always have to rerun jobs to apply any defined rules.

#### Finding the Merged Resource

To verify the merge was successful, navigate back to Resource management.
From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.

In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Resources** tab and this time search for **computer1000**. Now you will see
just one instance in the list of Resources called computer1000 whereas before
you would have seen two. Click on **computer1000**, change the hop view to **2**
and click **Render**. You should see something like the following, showing the
combined topology segments:

![](images/computer.png)

The Resource computer1000 is only shown once in the topology, but remains
connected to all the resources it was connected to in both sets of topology
data, prior to the merge. The Merge Rule has effectively merged the two sets of
topology together, by merging the common Resources, according to the rule that
we defined.

You have now completed this chapter and are ready for next one about "topology templates".
