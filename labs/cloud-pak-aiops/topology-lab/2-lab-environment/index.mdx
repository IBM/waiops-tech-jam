In this Lab, you will have access to one OpenShift cluster via a bastion virtual
machine that has installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Note that inside
OpenShift, the cluster has installed the Cloud Pak for AIOps. It also has
installed the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) which is a
software-defined, container-native storage solution that provides storage
classes that will be used by the Cloud Pak for AIOps to dynamically request
storage.

The following diagram describes the infrastructure for the Lab:
