Coined by Gartner, AIOps—i.e. artificial intelligence for IT operations—is the
application of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, such as natural
language processing and machine learning models, to automate and streamline
operational workflows. The IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps is an AIOps platform that
deploys advanced, explainable AI using the IT Operations (ITOps) toolchain data
so that you can confidently assess, diagnose, and resolve incidents across
mission-critical workloads.

IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps eases the path to adopting advanced AI for ITOps to
decrease your operational costs. With this Cloud Pak, you can increase your
customer satisfaction by proactively avoiding incidents and accelerating your
time to resolution.

By integrating multiple separate, manual IT operations tools with into a single,
intelligent, and automated IT operations platform, AIOps enables IT operations
teams to respond more quickly—even proactively—to slowdowns and outages, with
end-to-end visibility and context. It bridges the gap between an increasingly
diverse, dynamic, and difficult-to-monitor IT landscape and siloed teams, on the
one hand, and user expectations for little or no interruption in application
performance and availability, on the other.

Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Topology Lab. You will be going through
several key exercises that will help you learn key skills around how to consume
and manage infrastructure and application topology information. Topology or
Resource information helps IT Operations personnel quickly locate and understand
the problem at hand and find the root cause.

### Lab Content

In this Lab, we will focus on a subset of the main features available in
**Resource Management** such as:

- how to collect topology data
- how to use rules to merge topology elements
- how to use templates to gather resources into logical groups
- how to define applications from groups and business criticality

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed
in prior sections.

The complete set of **Resource Management** capabilities can be found in the
[**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-aiops/4.7.0?topic=topologies-managing).
