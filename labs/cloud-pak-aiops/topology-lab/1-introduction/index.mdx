Coined by Gartner, AIOps—i.e. artificial intelligence for IT operations—is the application of artificial intelligence 
(AI) capabilities, such as natural language processing and machine learning models, to automate and streamline operational 
workflows. The IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps is an AIOps platform that deploys advanced, explainable AI using the IT Operations 
(ITOps) toolchain data so that you can confidently assess, diagnose, and resolve incidents across mission-critical workloads.

IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps eases the path to adopting advanced AI for ITOps to decrease your operational costs. With this 
Cloud Pak, you can increase your customer satisfaction by proactively avoiding incidents and accelerating your time to resolution.

By integrating multiple separate, manual IT operations tools with into a single, intelligent, and automated IT operations 
platform, AIOps enables IT operations teams to respond more quickly—even proactively—to slowdowns and outages, with end-to-end 
visibility and context. It bridges the gap between an increasingly diverse, dynamic, and difficult-to-monitor IT landscape and 
siloed teams, on the one hand, and user expectations for little or no interruption in application performance and availability, on the other.

Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Topology Lab. You will be going through several key exercises 
that will help you learn key skills around how to consume and manage infrastructure and application topology information.
Topology or Resource information helps IT Operations personnel quickly locate and understand the problem at hand and find the root cause.


### Lab Content


In this Lab, we will focus in a subset of the main features available in **Resource Management** such as:

* how to collect topology data
* how to use rules to merge topology elements
* how to use templates to gather resources into logical groups
* how to define applications from groups and business criticality


The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.

The complete set of **Resource Management** capabilities can be found in the [**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=topologies-managing).
