## 6.1: Business Criticality

The business criticality of a resource provides an indication of how critical to the business
that resource is, and therefore how important any related problems might be. You can define the levels 
of business criticality for your applications, resource groups and resources, 
and then view a list of them on the Business criticality page.

Lets have a quick overview of Policies as they leverage Business Criticality. Policies are rules that contain multiple 
condition and action sets. They can be triggered to reduce noise by suppressing alerts, grouping alerts together, automatically 
promote alerts to incidents, assign runbooks to remediate alerts, etc.

:::note
The topic of **Policies** is outside the scope of this Lab, but additional information can be found in the product 
[**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=policies-creating).
:::

Business Criticality plays a major factor in making sure that Policies reflect business priorities in terms
of what applications affect business operations the most. 
Policies can be defined in a way that considers the Business criticality as a factor to take an action
such as promoting Alerts to an Incident that IT Ops. personnel can see in the Incident View. 



### Defining Business Criticality

Now we will define some business criticality values that can then be assigned to an application later in the Lab.

* From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.
* In the **Resource management** page, click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top-right and select 
**Topology configuration**.

* From the **Topology configuration** page, in the **Business criticality** card, select **Configure**.

The Business criticality page is displayed listing any existing criticality definitions in a table format
by name, description, and criticality value, in sortable columns. For the purpose of the Lab, we will use 
the predefined criticality values but note that you can custom define these values to better represent 
your specific IT environment. 

Click on **Start with presets**, inspect the preset values and click on **Add**.

We have now defined three tiers of business criticality as shown below:

## 6.2: Applications or Services?

Based on customer feedback, starting in v4.1, the Cloud Pak for AIOps provides the option to call a 
collection of topology groups an **Application** or a **Service**. From a product functionality point of view, there is no 
difference between these two terms. But depending on the customer industry, these two terms represent two different abstractions. 
In the Telecommunications industry, a *Service* represents a group of interconnected components such as routers, switches, firewalls, etc. 
that participate in the operation of voice and data communications. In mostly every other industry, an *Application* represents a set of IT resources 
that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another Application. In this Lab, we
are using the term *Application*. 

In summary, an Application, in the context of the Cloud Pak for AIOps, is a collection of topology resource groups that represent a complete IT solution stack. Applications, 
when combined with resource-level event correlation and grouping mechanisms, 
provide roll-up incident visibility. In other words, Alerts impacting resources will also surface
as impacting the Applications that those resources belong to. This improves overall visibility and 
allows the prioritization of incident resolution based on the business criticality that has been preassigned to the impacted applications.



### Defining Applications

You define and edit applications by adding (or removing) resource groups, icons and tags, 
assigning business criticality levels, and setting service disruption costs.

Lets define a fictional application based on the existing topology resource groups:

* From the burger menu in the top-left, navigate to: **Operate → Resource management**.
* In the **Resource management** page, click the **Define application** button in the top-right. 
* In the **Define application** page, we will select a subset of the resource groups defined in previous 
chapters using Topology Group Templates. These are the resource groups that belong to our fictional application. 
Lets select APPSERVER-computer1000, APPSERVER-computer1001 and ROUTER-router1 as shown below: 

![](images/select-resource-groups.png)

* Click **Next** to preview the application. 

As we preview the application, we can use the checkbox to deselect resource groups on the right sidebar
in order to visualize the application without those groups. 

* In this preview step, we realize that we don't need the ROUTER-router1 resource group, so click on the (-) minus sign to remove
the ROUTER-router1 resource group from this application.

* You should be left with the topology preview as
shown below:

![](images/topology-final.png)



* Click **Next** to add additional details.
* Enter a **Name** for the application, for example **Order Capture Backend**
* Set an **Icon** for the application, using the drop-down list select the **backend** icon. This icon is used to identify the application 
resource type in the topology view of your applications.
* Mark the application as a **favorite** by clicking on the heart icon. 
* In the **Add tags** field, type **orderBackend** and select **Create new tag**. Tags can be used to 
identify similar applications and to distinguish applications from other applications.
* In the **Business criticality** field, select **Tier 1**.
* In the **Estimated cost per minute for service disruption**, type **750**. This numerical value, represents the 
estimated disruption cost (in local currency) for the business per minute if this application is down. 
This information is used on the **AIOps insights** dashboard.

You should see the application details as shown below: 


![](images/details.png) 

* Click **Define application**. 

Now the application is added to the list of all applications on the page, as shown below. Note that from this 
view we can see total number of resources, the active Incidents and Alerts related to the application.

## 6.3: Lab Recap


Congratulations if you made it here!. We have seen a lot of features in a short period of time. If there 
is a single thought that you can take away from this Lab, this is it:

*A real-time, unified Topology View is a core capability of the Cloud Pak for AIOps, as it allows to visualize
topology changes over time, anomalous alerts in context and the correlation of alerts based on the impacted topology resources.
Topology is a key component to achieve fast incident resolution through the Cloud Pak for AIOps.*
