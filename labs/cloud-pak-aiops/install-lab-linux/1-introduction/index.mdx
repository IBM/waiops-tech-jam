Coined by Gartner, AIOps—i.e. artificial intelligence for IT operations—is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, 
such as natural language processing and machine learning models, to automate and streamline operational workflows.
The IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps is an AIOps platform that deploys advanced, explainable AI using the IT Operations 
(ITOps) toolchain data so that you can confidently assess, diagnose, and resolve incidents across mission-critical workloads.

IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps eases the path to adopting advanced AI for ITOps to decrease your operational 
costs. With this Cloud Pak, you can increase your customer satisfaction by proactively avoiding incidents and 
accelerating your time to resolution.

By integrating multiple separate, manual IT operations tools with into a single, intelligent, and automated IT 
operations platform, AIOps enables IT operations teams to respond more quickly—even proactively—to slowdowns and outages, 
with end-to-end visibility and context. It bridges the gap between an increasingly diverse, dynamic, and difficult-to-monitor 
IT landscape and siloed teams, on the one hand, and user expectations for little or no interruption in application performance and availability, on the other. 

Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Install Lab. You will be going through several key exercises that will help 
you learn key skills around how to plan and install this product.


### Lab Content

In this Lab, we will explore the following topics:

* How to prepare a set of Linux virtual machines for installation of AIOps
* How to install a small size deployment of the Cloud Pak for AIOps onto Linux VMs

:::note

The Linux VM based installation of AIOps does not use OpenShift. It instead uses a lightweight Kubernetes platform (K3S), which deploys very rapidly and therefore makes it ideal for demonstrations, proof-of-concepts, and sandbox environments. For production use however, OpenShift is an enterprise-grade container platform that provides a lot more day-2-operations capabilities out of the box, therefore is ideal for this deployment scenario. OpenShift deployments take more time to deploy and set up however, which is why the Linux-based deployment is ideal for quick trials and demos.

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.
