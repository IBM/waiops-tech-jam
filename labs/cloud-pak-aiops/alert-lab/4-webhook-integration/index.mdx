title: 4. Webhook and Kafka Data Load
description: Set up a webhook and kafka integration
sidebar_position: 4
---

In this section, we will configure a generic webhook connection. If a dedicated connection is 
not available for a data source, you can use the generic webhook connection to provide an endpoint
for applications to send JSON format events to the Cloud Pak for AIOps via HTTP POST requests. 
You can also include a *JSONata* file to map incoming JSON payloads to the Cloud Pak for AIOps 
event data schema. The webhook endpoint is exposed via an OpenShift edge route that includes a unique, 
automatically-generated ID.

Also in this section, we will create a couple of bash scripts. The first script will be used to load data
via the webhook connection and the second script will be used to load data into a kafka topic. 
The usage of these two scripts will become more clear as you move into the different sections of the Lab. 



## 4.1: Creating a Webhook Connection

Log into the Cloud Pak for AIOps: 
* from the burger menu in the top-left navigate to: **Define → Data and tool connections**
* from the **Data and tool connections** page click on **Add connection**
* from the **Add connections** page search for **webhook**, click on the
 **Generic Webhook** tile and click **Connect**. 

Fill the **Add connection** form with these values: 

* Name: event-webhook
* Description: custom webhook connection for events
* Authentication type: *select Username/Password*
* Username: pick a username (e.g. test)
* Password: pick a password (e.g. test)

Your complete form should look like this (note that your route will be different)

Click **Next**. 

In the **Configure event mapping** form:

* Confirm the **Enable webhook** slider is green (On)
* The webhook connector leverages JSONata which is a simple expression language to transform JSON data. 
You can read about JSONata [here](https://jsonata.org/). In this Lab, we provide the JSON event format
as expected by the Cloud Pak for AIOPs, therefore the JSONata is just a "passthrough". In a real scenario, 
you will find this mapping capability very useful. Enter the following JSONata configuration:

```json
{
   "sender":{
      "service": sender.service,
      "name": sender.name,
      "type": sender.type
   },
   "resource":{
      "application": resource.application,
      "name": resource.name,
      "hostname": resource.hostname,
      "type": resource.type,
      "ipaddress": resource.ipaddress,
      "location": resource.location
   },
   "type":{
      "classification": type.classification,
      "eventType": type.eventType
   },
   "severity": severity,
   "summary": summary,
   "occurrenceTime": occurrenceTime,
   "expirySeconds": expirySeconds
}
```

Click on **Done**.
You will see a new webhook created as shown below:

## 4.2: Create the Webhook Event Loader Script

Lets create a **lab** **folder** for the upcoming files in the home directory and change to this new folder. 
Run the following command from the Terminal window:

```
cd; mkdir lab; cd lab
```


We will create a simple bash script that reads an event file and calls the webhook 
URL with every event in the file as a parameter. 

Create a file called **event-load-webhook.sh** by running the following command in the Terminal window to open the text editor
, **copy** the bash script below (use the copy helper icon (top-right) for one-click copy), **paste** it into the text editor.

```
gedit event-load-webhook.sh
```


```sh
#!/bin/bash
# this is the event-load-webhook.sh script

# Check if a file is provided as a parameter
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Please provide an event file as a parameter."
  exit 1
fi

###########################################
WEBHOOK_URL='<insert the webhook URL here>'
# Note below there is a colon character ':' between the username and password e.g. test:test
AUTH=<insert your chosen user name>:<insert your chosen password>
###########################################


# Read the event file line by line and submit the event via webhook
while IFS= read -r line; do
  curl -X POST -u $AUTH --insecure -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $WEBHOOK_URL -d "$line"
  echo ""
done < "$1"
```

There are two changes you need to make to the script:
*  assign to WEBHOOK_URL the webhook route of the webhook you just created in the previous step
*  assign to AUTH the chosen user name and password of the webhook you just created in the previous step e.g. test:test

Click on the **Save** button in the text editor and **close** the editor window (click on the X). 





## 4.3: Create a Kafka Event Loader Script

Finally, we will create another simple bash script that will take an event or alert file and a 
kafka topic as parameters and it will load this data into the kafka topic. 

Create a new file called *event-load-kafka.sh* by running the following command in the Terminal window to open the text editor
, **copy** the bash script below, **paste** it into the text editor,
click on the **Save** button in the text editor and **close** the editor window (click on the X). 

```
gedit event-load-kafka.sh
```

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# this is the event-load-kafka.sh script

# Check parameters
if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "Please provide an event file and a kafka topic as parameters"
  exit 1
fi

export EVENTS_FILE="$1"
export KAFKA_TOPIC="$2"

oc project cp4waiops
