Welcome to the Cloud Pak for AIOps Topology Lab. You will be going through several key exercises 
that will help you learn key skills around how to consume and manage infrastructure and application topology information.
Topology or Resource information help IT Operations personnel quickly locate and understand the problem at hand and find the root cause.


### Lab Content


In this Lab, we will focus in a subset of the main features available in **Resource Management** such as:

* how to collect topology data
* how to use rules to merge topology elements
* how to use templates to gather resources into logical groups
* how to define applications from groups and business criticality


The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed in prior sections.

The complete set of **Resource Management** capabilities can be found in the [**documentation**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/4.1.0?topic=topologies-managing).
