## 4.1: Overview

This module focuses on the set up of a webhook integration, so that events can
be received from a cloud event source. We will configure a generic webhook
integration with SevOne as an example.

By the end of this module, you will have configured a webhook to be able to
receive events from a SevOne system.

:::note

A full list of the incoming event integrations are documented here:
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=systems-configuring-incoming-integrations

## 4.2: Create a new generic webhook integration with SevOne

While the event integrations provide a large number of off-the-shelf
integrations, it is typical that a user will have an event source for which
there is no corresponding integration. Like everything with Netcool, where there
is not an off-the-shelf option, there is always the generic option of
integration as a backstop. In this exercise, we will create a generic webhook
integration with SevOne.

The basic steps to creating a generic webhook integration are as follows:

1. Assuming the event source is capable of sending to a webhook, obtain a sample
   payload from that source system
2. Create the integration via the Event Manager UI
3. Paste the sample JSON event payload into the sample box
4. Specify the payload-to-field mappings
5. Test the integration

:::caution

When you create a new webhook integration in Event Manager, it is essential to
copy the generated webhook URL and save it in a text document for future
reference. After the integration is saved, there is no way to retrieve the URL
(although you can regenerate a new one).

:::

:::note

In this exercise, it is assumed that the webhook configuration has been done
already on the SevOne side, and it only awaits the webhook URL.

:::

First, navigate to: **Administration > Integration with other systems**. Click
on **New integration** and **Configure** a new generic **Webhook** integration:

Use the following steps to set up your integration:

- Configure the Name field with a label to identify your webhook - eg. "SevOne"
- Copy the generated URL and save it to a text file for later use
- Copy your sample SevOne payload into: **Example incoming request**
- Configure the Event attributes
- Check the Result field, to ensure there are no errors, and the mapped values
  are showing
- Click Generate to generate a test event using the sample
- Check the event in the Event List to ensure it looks correct
- Copy the generated webhook over to your SevOne system as an vent target

A sample SevOne payload is provided below, which may be used to set up this
integration (copy into **Example incoming request**):

```sh
{
"deviceName": "testDeviceName",
"occurrences": "4",
"triggeringConditions": "Test",
"thresholdId": "1-0",
"check": "Website Alerts - testObjectName",
"host": "testDeviceName",
"assignedTo": "engineer@widgetcom.com",
"pluginDescription": "HTTP Poller",
"groupName": "All Devices",
"objectName": "testObjectName",
"routes": ["Netcool"],
"alertMessage": "Default Alert Message",
"hashtag": "hash",
"policyId": "0",
"hash": "hash",
"url": "url",
"deviceId": "-1",
"alertState": "Alert",
"sender": "SevOne",
"objectAltName": "testObjectAltName",
"thresholdName": "Website Alerts - testDeviceName - testObjectName",
"alertType": "Metric",
"alertId": "-1",
"objectId": "-1",
"cluster": "All Devices",
"description": "Default Alert Message",
"deviceIp": "10.1.2.3",
"policyName": "Website Alerts",
"objectDescription": "testObjectDescription",
"pluginName": "HTTP"
}
```

Regarding the **Event attributes**, the following example mappings can be used:

```sh
Severity: alertState = "Emergency" ? "Critical" : alertState = "Alert" ? "Critical" : alertState = "Critical" ? "Critical" : alertState = "Error" ? "Major" : alertState = "Cleared" ? "Cleared"
Summary: description
Resource name: deviceName
Event type: policyName
* Resolution:  alertState = "Cleared"
* Sender: Name: sender
* URL 1: URL: url
* URL 1: Description: url

* Fields marked with an asterisk first need to be added via the Optional event attributes link.

```

:::info

Further information regarding the generic webhook event integration can be found
here, including a table that maps the integration attributes to event fields in
the Event Manager event store (Netcool/OMNIbus ObjectServer):
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/noi/1.6.5?topic=integrations-webhook

:::

:::info

Complex mappings such as the Severity field example above can be mapped using
JSONATA functions: http://docs.jsonata.org/object-functions.html

:::

The completed configuration should look something like the following:

![](images/mapping.png)

The sample event generated via the **Generate** function should look something
like the following:

You could now take the URL you copied from the new integration to SevOne and use
it to set up a new event target.

You have now completed this module and are ready for module "Create sample
topology in Watson for AIOps Event Manager".
