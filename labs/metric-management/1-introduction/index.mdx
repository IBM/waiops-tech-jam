This lab is not part of the April Tech Jam.

:::

In these set of labs, we will be working with both the on-prem deployment of
Metric Manager (formerly known as Predictive Insights), and the emerging Metric
Anomaly Detection (MAD) component that is part of the CloudPak for Watson AIOps
AI Manager installation. Working with Metric Manager will help you understand
fundamentals of data mediation, and allow you to support customers who are
currently using it. It is, in general, recommended to go with Watson AIOps for
greenfield customers, but there may be certain POCs where it may make more sense
to use Metric Manager to do your anomaly analysis due to off-the-shelf
integrations and the ability to more easily search and display historical
anomalies.

The labs will start out with kicking off an installation of Watson AIOps AI
Manager to support lab 7, then go through installation of the VM-based Metric
Manager including installation of the latest fix pack. Then you will learn how
to model and mediate data that resides in CSV files. You will learn how to
access the results of the analysis and machine learning. You will then learn how
to mediate data using the REST interface available in both VM-based Metric
Manager, and Watson AIOps Metric Anomaly Detection (MAD). Finally, you will
explore the new capabilities of Watson AIOps Metric Anomaly Detection.
