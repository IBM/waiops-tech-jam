### The Value of IBM Concert for OS Patch Management

IBM Concert transforms OS patch management from a fragmented, manual process into a centralized AI-orchestrated workflow.

By aggregating data from vulnerability scanners, infrastructure inventories, and CVE feeds, Concert builds a contextual view of your entire landscape. Rather than a blunt "patch everything" approach, it uses generative AI to prioritize remediation based on risk, business criticality, and system dependencies, ensuring that the most vital vulnerabilities are addressed first.

The platform provides significant operational value by automating the end-to-end lifecycle—covering discovery, advisory ingestion, execution, and reporting. 

#### Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Remediation:** Reduces the median time to patch by up to an order of magnitude, significantly shrinking the window of exposure to critical CVEs.
- **Tool Orchestration:** Instead of replacing existing investments, Concert integrates with and triggers tools like **Ansible** and **ServiceNow** to standardize execution and automate compliance tracking.
- **Operational Efficiency:** By automating ticket-driven tasks and handling complex dependencies, Concert lowers operational overhead and allows teams to shift focus toward high-value resilience and optimization work.

Through this combination of risk-aware planning and automated execution, IBM Concert strengthens the security posture of **RHEL** and hybrid-cloud workloads while ensuring consistent, documented compliance across the enterprise.

### Client Example: Deutsche Telekom

Deutsche Telekom gains significant efficiency and security improvements from IBM Concert in OS patch management. The platform automates patching for systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Windows Servers, slashing manual efforts.

#### Key Benefits
- **10x Faster Patching:** Median time to patch critical vulnerabilities dropped from 80 hours to 8 hours, with per-instance patching reduced from 90 minutes to 20 minutes (a 78% cut).
- **AI-Powered Automation:** Provides a single source of truth by integrating vulnerability data, app details, and CVE databases for risk prioritization and end-to-end orchestration, including Ansible integration in hybrid clouds.
- **Cost and Effort Reduction:** Lowers operational costs, minimizes human error, and frees IT teams for strategic tasks like innovation.
