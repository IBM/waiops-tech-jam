# Lab Environment

In this Lab, you will have access to three RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) virtual machines plus a bastion virtual machine 
that will let you access the overall deployment:

* VM1 has preinstalled IBM Concert + Workflows
* VM2 has preinstalled Instana which comes with a self-monitoring agent.
* VM3 has the CI/CD tool Jenkins installed. In addition, it has the demo application Quote of the Day (qotd) running on 
top of a [K3S](https://k3s.io/) lightweight Kubernetes cluster . This cluster has an Instana agent preinstalled to monitor deployed applications.
