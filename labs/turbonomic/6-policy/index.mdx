## 6.1: Introduction

Turbonomic defines a set of default policies for each entity type which are used
to analyze data and make action recommendations.

Users can define their own policies for each entity in the supply chain based on
business requirements.

Policies define business rules to control how Turbonomic

- analyzes resource allocation.
- displays resource status
- recommends or executes actions.

In this lab, you will configure an SLO policy for the Robot Shop application to
understand how Turbonomic ARM uses target data already configured to make action
recommendations that will assure application performance.

## 6.2: Create Groups

In Turbonomic ARM, groups:

- are a collection of like entities.
- can be used any place where you can scope.
- are automatically created in some cases.

Now we first need to create the group containing the Robot Shop business
application.

In the Turbonomic ARM user interface:

1. Click on `Settings -> Groups`:

1. Click on `NEW GROUP`:

1. Click on `Container Spec`:

   ![](images/groups-3.png)

1. Enter the group name as `Robot Shop Group` and select the `Dynamic` type:

   :::info Static vs Dynamic

   - use Dynamic groups if there is criteria which can define your group.
   - use Static groups when:
     - You do not expect membership to ever change.
     - There is no criteria that can be used to define the group.

   ![](images/policy-6.png)

1. Then click the `SAVE AND APPLY` button. With the policy configured,
   Turbonomic will analyze performance data over time and then provide placement
   and resource sizing recommendations.

1. The scoped policy you have created can be found in the `Automation Policies`
   category:

   ![](images/policy-7.png)

1. The `Imported Placement Policies` category is specifically for imported
   on-prem policies:

   types.
