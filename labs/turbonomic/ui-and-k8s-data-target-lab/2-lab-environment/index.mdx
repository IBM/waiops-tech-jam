# Lab Environment

In this lab you will have access to two Openshift clusters:

1. **AIOps cluster** - A full installation of OCP that has Turbonomic
   pre-installed. Instana and the Instana Agent have also already been
   pre-installed and integrated with Turbonomic for you.
2. **Apps cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that has an Instana
   Agent and the demo applications _RobotShop_ and _Quote Of The Day_
   pre-installed and sending metrics to Instana.

In this lab you will explore the UI of the Turbonomic Server running on the
AIOps cluster. You will also install the Turbonomic Kubeturbo agent on the Apps
Single Node OpenShift Cluster and connect it to the Turbonomic Server running on
the AIOps Cluster (highlighted in yellow).
