# Lab Environment

In this lab you will have access to two Openshift clusters:

   Instana and Turbonomic Server.
2. **Apps cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that has the demo
   applications _RobotShop_ and _Quote Of The Day_ pre-installed.

You will be exploring the UI of the Turbonomic Server running on the AIOps
cluster. You will also be installing the Turbonomic Kubeturbo agent on the Apps
Single Node OpenShift Cluster and connecting it to the Turbonomic Server running
