# Introduction

Welcome to the Explore the UI & Kubeturbo lab of the Turbonomic Jam-in-a-box
series you will be going through several key exercises that will help you learn
more about the Turbonomic User Interface and the Kubernetes probe. You will
cover topics such as:

- Understanding the different UI elements in Turbonomic.
- Understanding key terminology in Turbonomic.
- Introduction to navigation into Business Applications sourced from Instana.
- Installation of the Turbonomic Kubernetes probe to get kubernetes metrics into
  Turbonomic.

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed
in prior sections.
