## Introduction

In the Turbonomic Application Resource Management (ARM) portion of the Tech Jam
lab, you will be going through several key exercises in order to learn more
about Turbonomic ARM.

The labs should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen. Some of the sections have dependencies on the previous section.

- First, you will be learning how to install Turbonomic ARM on OpenShift.
- Then, you will learn how to integrate your business application data with the
  Turbonomic ARM server for application oriented assurance recommendations.
- You will next learn how to navigate and interpret the user interface.
- Next, you will learn how to integrate data from a Kubernetes / OpenShift
  cluster that your application runs and relies on.
- Then you will learn how to configure a policy to set business rules for your
  business applications.
- Finally, you will learn about recommendations and actions, as well as how to
  execute them to assure application performance.

These labs focus on a Kubernetes based application scenarios using application
performance management data from Instana, with a view to building out a starter
demo environment.

More labs will be added in the future to explore more advanced scenarios and
features of Turbonomic ARM.
