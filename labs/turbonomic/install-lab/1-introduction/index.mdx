# Introduction

Welcome to the Turbonomic Installation lab of Jam-in-a-box series. You will be
going through several key exercises that will help you learn more about the
installation and configuration of the Turbonomic Server and integration of
Instana. You will cover topics such as:

- The installation process for the Turbonomic Platform running on OpenShift.
- Licensing the Turbonomic Server.
- Creating a suitable API token in Instana.
- Integrating Instana with Turbonomic to ingest Application Performance
  Monitoring data.

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed
in prior sections.
