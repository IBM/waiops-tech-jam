# Lab Environment

In this lab you will have access to two Openshift clusters:

1. **AIOps cluster** - A full installation of OCP that includes Instana, Instana
   Agent and Turbonomic all pre-installed Instana and Turbonomic Server.
2. **Apps cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that has Kubeturbo,
   Instana Agent and the demo applications _RobotShop_ and _Quote Of The Day_
   pre-installed.

You will be diving into Turbonomic and learning about Turbonomic Policies and
Actions. In the lab you will configure an SLO policy for the Robot Shop
application to understand how Turbonomic ARM uses target data already configured
to make action recommendations that will assure application performance.
