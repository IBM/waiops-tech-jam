# Configure Policies

## Introduction

Turbonomic defines a set of default policies for each entity type which are used
to analyze data and make action recommendations.

Users can define their own policies for each entity in the supply chain based on
business requirements.

Policies define business rules to control how Turbonomic

- analyzes resource allocation.
- displays resource status
- recommends or executes actions.

In this lab, you will configure an SLO policy for the Robot Shop application to
understand how Turbonomic ARM uses target data already configured to make action
recommendations that will assure application performance.

## 3.1: Open the Turbonomic Dashboard

:::tip

If you are unsure how to get access to the Bastion host (Guacamole) see
[Accessing a Lab Environment](/waiops-tech-jam/labs/jam-in-a-box/#accessing-a-lab-environment)

:::

Open the Turbonomic ARM user interface in your browser:

1. Select **Activities** at the top left of the bastion host.

2. Select **Firefox**

3. Click on the **Turbonomic** bookmark.

4. Login to Turbonomic

   - Username: `administrator`
   - Password: `Passw0rd`

:::warning

There is currently a known issue with the integration between Turbonomic and
Instana in the lab environment preventing data ingest from Instana.

Until this is resolved the workaround is to **re-save** and **rediscover** the
Instana target. To do this:

1. Select **Settings** from the left navigation pane
2. Select **Target Configuration**
3. Edit the **Instana** target that is in a critical state. DO NOT change
   anything. Just click **Save**.
4. Check the checkbox next to the **Instana** target and click **Rediscover**

This will force a re-discovery of the Instana target and should resolve the
issue. The UI will begin to populate with data from Instana after a few minutes.

## 3.2: Create Groups

In Turbonomic ARM, groups:

- are a collection of like entities.
- can be used any place where you can scope.
- are automatically created in some cases.

Now we first need to create the group containing the Robot Shop business
application.

In the Turbonomic ARM user interface:

1. Click on **Settings** -> **Groups**:

   ![](images/turbo-groups-1.png)

1. Click on **NEW GROUP**:

   ![](images/groups-2.png)

1. Click on **Container Spec**:

   ![](images/groups-3.png)

1. Enter the group name as `Robot Shop Group` and select the **Dynamic** type:

   :::info Static vs Dynamic

   - use Dynamic groups if there is criteria which can define your group.
   - use Static groups when:
     - You do not expect membership to ever change.
     - There is no criteria that can be used to define the group.

   :::

1. Click on **ADD FILTER** and select **Namespace**

1. Select filter **Equals** and enter the expression `robot-shop` then click the
   **Apply** button:

   :::caution

   Untick any other checkboxes that are selected.

   :::

   ![](images/groups-5.png)

1. Click on the **SAVE GROUP** button:

   ![](images/groups-6.png)

   You should now see the **Robot Shop Group** newly created.

## 3.3: Setup a Policy

1. Click on **Settings** and select **Policies**:

   ![](images/turbo-settings-policies.png)

1. Then click on **NEW AUTOMATION POLICY**:

   ![](images/policy-1.png)

1. Select **Container Spec** as the policy type for the Robot Shop application:

   ![](images/policy-2.png)

1. Fill in the name as `Robot Shop Container Spec Policy` and click on **ADD
   CONTAINER SPEC GROUPS**:

   ![](images/policy-3.png)

1. Select the **Robot Shop Group** checkbox and click on the **SELECT** button.

   ![](images/policy-4.png)

1. Expand the **SCALING CONSTRAINTS** section:

   ![](images/policy-5.png)

1. Configure the scaling constraints as in the image below:

   ![](images/policy-6.png)

1. Then click the **SAVE AND APPLY** button. With the policy configured,
   Turbonomic will analyze performance data over time and then provide placement
   and resource sizing recommendations with no minimum observation period.

1. The scoped policy you have created can be found in the **Automation
   Policies** category:

   ![](images/policy-7.png)

1. The **Imported Placement Policies** category is specifically to filter for
   imported on-prem policies:

   ![](images/turbo-imported-policies.png)

1. The **Defaults** category represents the policies that govern entire entity
   types. If you were to change these policies they would apply to all entities
   of that type.

   ![](images/turbo-imported-defaults.png)

1. Now go back to the Turbonomic dashboard by clicking the green **on** at the
   top left of the page. **Wait for up to 10 minutes** and you will notice there
   are **Actions** now:

   :::caution The Demo Environment Could Take Some Time

   Each environment may be performing a little differently to others. Depending
   on the environment you may see either _Global Pending Actions_ or _Business
   Application Actions_ or both.

   As long as you see at least one of these, you can proceed with the lab. If
   not you should wait a little longer for Turbonomic to collect more data and
   suggest possible actions.

   If required you can increase the load on the Robot Shop application by
   scaling the _load generator_. From the bastion node open a new Terminal and
   run
   `oc scale --replicas=2 deployment rs-website-load -n robot-shop --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig-apps`.

## 3.4: Editing a Policy

:::caution Information Only

This is for information only, there is no need to actually edit any policy for
these labs.

:::

To edit a policy, navigate to **Settings** -> **Policies** and select the policy
you would like to edit:

![](images/turbo-edit-policy.png)

Make your changes and save.

## 3.5: Deleting a Policy

:::caution Information Only

This is for information only, there is no need to actually delete a policy for
these labs.

:::

18. To delete a policy navigate to **Settings** -> **Policies** and select the
    checkbox next to the policy you want to delete. Then click the **Trash**
    icon:

## 3.6: Summary

In this section, you have learned how to create a scoped policy for a container
spec, in this case to govern an application container spec.

Next, we will look at how to take actions to assure application performance.
