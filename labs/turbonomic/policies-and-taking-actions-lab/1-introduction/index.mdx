# Introduction

Welcome to the Policies & Taking Actions lab in the Turbonomic Jam-in-a-box
series you will be going through several key exercises that will help you learn
more about Turbonomic Policies and Actions. You will cover topics such as:

- Understanding and creating Turbonomic Groups with dynamic filters.
- Creating Turbonomic Policies to control the behavior of Turbonomic.
- Executing Turbonomic Actions to take actions on your environment.
- Viewing the application environment in Instana before and after taking actions
  in Turbonomic.

The lab should be executed in the numbered order that you see on the left side
of the screen in the navigation pane as sections likely depend on work completed
in prior sections.
