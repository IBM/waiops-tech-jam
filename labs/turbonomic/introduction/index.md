In the Turbonomic Application Resource Management (ARM) section of the AIOps
Jam-in-a-Box series you will be going through several key exercises in order to
learn more about Turbonomic ARM.

There are three Turbonomic labs:

- [**Install Turbo & Integrate Instana**](../install-lab/1-introduction/index.mdx)
  - Install Turbonomic ARM on OpenShift.
  - Integrate your application monitoring data with Turbonomic for application
    oriented assurance recommendations.
- [**Explore the UI & Kubeturbo**](../ui-and-k8s-data-target-lab/1-introduction/index.mdx)
  - Learn how to navigate and interpret the different elements of the user
    interface.
  - Integrate data from Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters that run your
    applications.
- [**Policies & Taking Actions**](../policies-and-taking-actions-lab/1-introduction/index.mdx)
  - Configure SLO policies for applications.
  - Learn about recommendations and actions, and how to execute them to assure
    application performance.

More labs will be added in the future to explore more advanced scenarios and
features of Turbonomic ARM.
