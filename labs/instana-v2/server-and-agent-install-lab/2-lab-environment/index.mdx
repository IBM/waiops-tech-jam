# Lab Environment

The lab environment includes 2 Openshift clusters and 3 VMs.

Openshift clusters:

1. **AIOps OCP Cluster** - Not required for this lab.
2. **Apps SNO Cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that will be used
   to learn how to install the Instana agent in a Kubernetes/OpenShift
   environment.

Virtual Machines:

1. **Guacamole VM** - A RHEL VM that will be used as the _bastion host_ for the
   lab network. Guacamole has access to all lab VM's and clusters and will be
   your primary workstation for these labs.
2. **Instana** - An Ubuntu VM that will be used to install a single node
   self-hosted Instana server.
3. **MQACE** - An Ubuntu VM that contains the pre-installed IBM ACE and MQ
   middleware. This VM will be used to install the Instana agent and monitor the
   middleware.
