## 3.1: Create an Alert Channel

In order to notify people when problems occur in an Instana environment, you
must first have an **Alert Channel**. An Alert Channel is a mechanism that is
used to get Events out of Instana and into another system when _Events_ are
trigger.

There are a variety of Alert Channels including _email notifications_, _slack_,
_Watson AIOps_, and more. In this section we'll show you how to setup and an
Alert Channel. Later, in the Administrative section, we'll use that Alert
Channel to get a notification when an Event triggers.

Begin by selecting the **Settings** gear in the left side navigation. Then,
select **Alert Channel**

![](images/alertChannel2.png)

The screen will change to show the **Alert Channels**. Since this is a new
install of Instana, there are no Alert Channels defined.

In the upper right portion of the screen, click on the **Add Alert Channel**
dropdown and select **Email**

:::tip

There are several different types of **Alert Channels** to integrate **Events**
into a variety of solutions. The **Generic Webhook** is the most flexible and
supports integration into an number of tools like ServiceNow that support
Webhooks.

:::

![](images/email.png)

After selecting **Email** the screen will change to show the fields required to
configure the **Email** **Alert Channel**. An Alert Channel can be setup to
notify specific users or to notify a large groups of users. For example, you
might want all database related Events to be sent to a _database team email
alias_ for the DBAs. Or, you might want to notify a specific line of business or
the IT Operations team.

Here are the steps for setting up the **Email** channel.

- Enter a name for the alert. The name can be anything, but should be
  meaningful. For example, if the Alert Channel will be used to notify the MQ
  admins, like in this case call it something MQ related such as
  `MQ Email Channel`
- Enter the email address to notify. Notice that there is an **Add Email** link
  on the right side if you want to add multiple Email addresses. For the lab
  purpose, please use `jammer@localhost` email - Instana will be able to send
  email to your localhost email server

![](images/003-administer_instana.png)

Next, click the **Test Channel** button. This will attempt to send a test Email
to the address you specified. You'll see whether the Instana server has access
to the Email destination.

Check for the test email on the Instana server. Login to the Instana server in a
new Terminal tab using `ssh jammer@instana`. Once logged in use the `mail`
command as presented below to view the jammer users inbox:

![](images/test-mail-instana.png)

This will show one email received from **server@instana.com** to the
**jammer@localhost** email box.

Type **exit** to exit the mail prompt.

After successfully testing the Alert Channel, click the **Create** button to
save the **Alert Channel**

## 3.2: Create an Analytics Based Smart Alert

In this section, you will create an analytics based **Smart Alert** to detect
abnormal behavior within an application.

Click on **Applications** and then, select the **Quote of the Day** application.

![](images/applications-qotd.png)

Click on **Add Smart Alert** in the lower right corner.

![](images/smartAlert.png)

There is a simple and an advanced mode. We'll be using the advanced mode which
allows you to see all of the capabilities.

In the upper right corner of the dialog, select **Switch to Advanced Mode**

![](images/advanced.png)

In the upper left corner, you'll see that there are 4 different types of **Smart
Alerts**

- Slow Calls
- Erroneous Calls
- HTTP Status Codes
- Throughput (both high and low numbers of calls)

Leave the default of **Slow Calls**

![](images/slowCalls.png)

Scroll down. You'll see that there are number of options to determine which
calls you want to analyze.

- You can analyze the calls for this application or you can analyze specific
  services or endpoints.
- You can analyze **Inbound Calls** or **All Calls**
- You can include **Internal Calls**
- You can include **Synthetic Calls**

![](images/options4.png)

Leave the default settings.

Scroll down further until you see the widgets show in the screen capture below.

![](images/options2.png)

You'll notice that there are a variety of options including:

- The ability to change the percentile that is used for the evaluation
- The type of seasonality (static, daily, or weekly)
- whether you want to view the last 24 hours or 7 days of historical data
- Sensitivity.

:::important

Try out some of the options, but keep in mind that analytics based thresholds
will require a week of data and your system has only been running for a few
hours. You will see the below warning until you have enough data.

![](images/lack-of-data-warn.png)

Here is an example from an app that has been running longer. When you set it to
higher sensitivity, the number of red triangles show on the screen will change.
These red triangles indicate when thresholds would trigger if you had chosen
that setting.

![](images/sensitivity.png)

You don't want to receive a lot of alert by setting the sensitivity too high.
Usually, if you see more than 1 or two alerts per day, the sensitivity is
probably too high. But, it depends on the historical data that you're looking at
and the mission criticality of the application.

:::

In this case we will need to leave the default for this section, **Static
Threshold** as we do not have enough historical data.

![](images/qotd-static-threshold-alert.png)

Scroll down further.

You'll see that there are options for persistence over time. This ensures that
the conditions trigger for a reasonable length of time before an alert is
raised.

![](images/options3.png)

There is also an option to select an **Alert Channel**. In the previous section,
you created an Email Alert Channel.

Select the **Select Alert Channels** button. A dialog will open with the Alert
Channel that you created earlier. Select the channel.

:::note

It is possible to select multiple Alert Channels. For example, you can notify
people via Email and Slack. Or, let's assume there is a database Event, you can
notify the DBAs and you can notify that line of business that uses the database.

:::

Scroll further down on the page and you'll see a section titled **Additional
Alert Properties**

![](images/alertProperties.png)

In this section you will notice that there is a default title and description.
You can edit those fields and replace them with custom messages. As you type the
**Title** and **Description**, the upper right corner will update with a sample
of what the Event will look like when it triggers. There are other options such
as setting the **Alert Level** and whether or not the Event should be aggregated
into an **Incident**.

Fill in the fields as you desire. Then, click the ** Create** button to create
the **Smart Alert**

The **Smart Alert** dialog will close and you'll be back in the context of your
application. To see the **Smart Alert** that you just created, click on the
**Smart Alerts** tab at the top of the screen.

![](images/qotd-smart-alert-display.png)

---

## 3.3: Create a Static Threshold (Event)

Now, let's examine how a more traditional threshold is created and used in
conjunction with Alert Channels.

On the left side of the screen, select the **Settings** gear.

![](images/events.png)

The Settings menu provides access to most of the administrative tasks within
Instana. You'll notice menus for Events, Alerts, Alert Channels, API Tokens,
Users, Groups, Log Management Integration, and more.

Select **Events**

Once you click on **Events**, you will see a list of 300+ Events that are
defined as out of the box thresholds within Instana. If you want to filter the
list, you can do that in a number of ways via the drop down lists at the top of
the page.

![](images/filterEvents.png)

Notice that you can filter based on the Event type, severity, entity type,
state, or simply enter a keyword filter.

Select the **Entity Type** dropdown list and type `IBM MQ` into the field.
You'll notice that a few different options show up. Each of the options is an
Entity Type. You can filter on the Events related to the IBM MQ Queue Manager,
Queue, Channel, etc.

Select **IBM MQ Queue Manager** from the dropdown list.

![](images/qmEvents.png)

This will filter the Events to the list of Events that are written against the
IBM MQ Queue Manager entity type. There are several out of the box threshold
Events that will detect things like channel initiator status, queue manager
status, publish/subscribe engine status, and more.

Let's create a new Event now.

At the top of the screen, select the **+ New Event** link.

![](images/newEvent.png)

Fill in the following information for you new Event:

- Give your Event a name.
- Enter a description for the Event
- Select a severity (Warning or critical)
- Select the option of whether you want your Event to get correlated into
  Incidents
- Select a Grace Period.

![](images/newEvent1.png)

The Grace Period is a capability that allow you to avoid getting multiple alerts
during flapping. Let's say you are monitoring for high CPU utilization on a
server. If CPU utilization goes High, then Low, then High over a short period of
time, you typically only want to see **ONE** event. By setting a "Grace Period"
of something like 60 seconds, you would only receive 1 Event during that
interval.

Now, scroll down a little further and fill in the remaining options.

In the **Condition** section, select the dropdown and choose **Built-in
Metrics**. Most of your thresholds will be written against these **Built-in
Metrics**.

![](images/newEvent2.png)

:::info

The choice of _Custom metrics_ would only apply to custom metrics that are being
fed into Instana. The _System Rules_ are a specialized set of rules for doing
thing like detecting that an entity is _offline_.

:::

Once you select **Built-in Metrics** another dropdown list will appear. The new
dropdown list is asking for the **Entity type** that you are going to write your
threshold against.

In the **Entity type** dropdown, select **IBM MQ Queue**. Notice that you can
type in letters such as `IBM MQ` to filter the list.

![](images/newEvent3.png)

After specifying an **Entity type**, a new dropdown appears with a list of
available **Metrics**. Select the **Metric** dropdown and choose **Depth > Queue
Depth Percentage**.

![](images/newEvent4.png)

After selecting the _Metric_ some new dropdowns appear on the screen looking for
the following information:

- Time Window: This is the duration that you want to monitor and evaluate
- Aggregation: Since Instana is capture data at a high interval, you can use
  Min, Max, Avg, Sum as part of your evaluation.
- Operator: What type of evaluation do you want to do (>, < =, etc.)
- Percentage - This field is actually different depending on the metric you are
  evaluating. In this case, you are evaluating a metric that is a percentage.

In the dropdowns, choose **60 s** for the time window, **max** for the
Aggregation, **>** for the Operator, and **90** for the Percentage.

![](images/newEvent5.png)

This will cause the threshold to evaluate the **Queue Depth Percent** for 60
seconds and determine whether the maximum value during that interval exceeded
90%. If it did exceed 90%, then the Event will trigger.

Now you have to select the **Scope** that this threshold will apply to. Select
the dropdown list.

![](images/allEntities.png)

In the dropdown list, you'll see the following options:

- You have the option of applying this threshold to an **Application
  Perspective**. This would limit the scope of the threshold to a specific
  application.
- You can use a **Dynamic Focus Query** to filter to a specific list of MQ
  Queues.
- Or, you can have your threshold apply to **All Available Entities**.

Let's make this a global Event and choose the **All Available Entities** option.

Click the **Create** button to save your new Event.

:::tip

If you wanted to apply your Event to a subset of the MQ Queues, you would
specify a Dynamic Focus Query. The query would look something like this.

![](images/dynamicFocusQuery.png)

The easiest way to formulate a **Dynamic Focus Query** is to go to the
**Infrastructure** page and build a filter. It will guide you through the
options. Then, copy and paste the string into the **Event** editor.
![](images/infrastructure2.png)

A **Dynamic Focus Query** can be a complex expression using AND, OR, NOT, etc.
to filter to a subset of the entities. These queries are build using the
**Lucene** query language. For more information on the **Lucene** query
language, see the project documentation.
[Lucene's Query Language](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-filtering-dynamic-focus)

## 3.4: Setting up an Offline Event

A common monitoring scenario is to setup an **Offline** Event to detect an
Entity going offline. We're going to create an **Event** that will detect any
**Host** that goes offline.

To do this, select **New Event** again.

Enter the name `Host Offline`.

Enter the description `A host has gone offline`.

Select a **Grace Period** of **10s**.

Select **System Rules** as the **Source** under _2. Condition_. Then, select
**Offline event detection** for the **System Rule**

![](images/systemEvent.png)

Next, select the scope. Choose **Selected Entities Only (Dynamic Focus Query)**.

In the **Dynamic Focus Query**, you are going to specify something a little
different. Instead of entering **entity.type:host**, we are going to use
**entity.selfType:host**. The reason for this is that the former will filter on
all of the hosts, but will also include the child entities that are running on
the host. We only want to detect that the **Host** is offline. Therefore, we are
going to specify `entity.selfType:host`.

Copy and post the string into the Event definition.

```sh
entity.selfType:host
```

Your **Dynamic Focus Query** should look like this.

![](images/selfType.png)

Click the **Create** button to save your Event.

:::tip

If you want to see how **entity.type:host** vs. **entity.selfType:host**
behaves, you can open the Infrastructure view and add the queries into the
search bar and see the results. You'll see the same list of hosts returned
within the UI. But, when you use **selfType**, you'll notice that the server
towers **do not contain the pizza boxes** representing each of the **Entities**.

![](images/show-self-type.png)

## 3.5: Setup an Alert for the New Event

Now that you have a new Event defined, you need to define an Alert.

Alerts are used to notify people and teams via various Alert Channels. You
previously reviewed the options for Alert Channels. The Alerts will be sent to
one or more Alert Channels that you select.

Select **Settings** on the left side navigation. Then select **Alerts**

![](images/alerts.png)

Click on the **+ New Alert** link

![](images/newAlert.png)

Give the new **Alert** a name. Normally, the **Alert** name is something
meaningful to indicate who will be notified and the type of events being sent.
For example, **MQ Alerts**

Select the dropdown labeled **Alert on Event(s)** ![](images/alertOnEvents.png)

You will see that there are multiple options. You can setup an Alert for a
particular Entity Type. For example, you might setup an Alert for all Oracle
Database Events.

In your case, select **Alert on Event(s)**. This option allows you to select a
specific list of Events to forward to an Alert Channel(s).

Further down on the page, select the **Add Events** link.

![](images/addEvent.png)

Initially, you will see a list of ALL Events.

Let's filter the list to just a specific **Entity Type**. Select the **Entity
Type** dropdown list and select **IBM MQ Queue**

![](images/filterQueue.png)

You will now see a filtered list of Events related to IBM MQ Queues. Find the
Event you created in the previous section and select the checkbox. Then, select
the **Add 1 Event** button at the bottom.

![](images/choose-custom-event.png)

You will now see the 1 selected Event listed.

Scroll down to the **Scope** section. This determines which Entities this Alert
will apply to.

Select the **Apply on** dropdown list. You'll see that you can choose one of 3
options:

- Application Perspective: This option allows you to limit the scope of the
  alert to a specific application.
- Selected Entities Only: You use the dynamic focus queries to filter to a
  specific set of Entities
- All Available Entities: The Alert would apply to any Entity that triggered the
  Event threshold.

Select the **Selected Entities Only** option

![](images/selectedEntities.png)

A new widget will appear on the right side of the screen asking you to specify
the **Dynamic Focus Query**

In the entry field, enter the lucene query that will filter to the queue that is
used for the **Quote of the Day** application. In this case, we are looking for
1 specific queue. Enter the following value:

```sh
entity.ibmmq.queue.name:CP4I.DEMO.API.Q
```

![](images/new-alert-mq-scope.png)

:::note

Depending on the randomness of the load generation you may not see any selection
matches over the past 2 weeks like in the above screenshot. If you want to
trigger this alert more easily you could edit the custom event you created and
reduce the **Grace Period** to **10s** and the **Queue Depth Percentage** to
**50**.

:::

Next, click on the **+ Add Alert Channels** link

A dialog will open with a list of available **Alert Channels**. Select the Alert
Channel that you created earlier.

Then, click the **Add 1 Channel** button.

![](images/add-alert-channel.png)

Scroll down to the bottom. You will see an optional section where you can add
custom payloads by adding Key/Value pairs. We're going to skip that section.

Finally, click the **Create** button to save your Alert.

That completes this section of the lab.

---

## 3.6: Summary

At this point, you have created an Event and an Alert for that Event. The next
time the custom **Event** that you created triggers, an **Alert** will be sent
to the **Alert Channel**. In this case, a Email will be sent.

In this section of the lab, you learned how to create a Smart Alert, a
traditional Alert (Event), and learned how these Alerts are routed to the
correct people/teams via Alert Channels.
