# Introduction

In the Instana portion of the Tech Jam lab, you will be going through several
key exercises in order to learn more about Instana. The lab should be executed
in the numbered order that you see on the left side of the screen. Some of the
sections have dependencies on the previous section.

- First, you will be learning how to create and configure an Alert Channel to
  get alerts out of Instana when events are triggered.
- Then, you will learn how to create an Analytics based Smart Alert.
- You will next learn about how to configure more traditional threshold events
  in Instana.
- Next, you will learn how create Offline Events to alert when hosts go offline.
- Finally, you will combine what you have learned to configure an alert to be
  sent via an Alert Channel for one of the custom events you have created.
