# Environmental Information

The lab environment includes 2 Openshift clusters and 3 VMs.

Openshift clusters:

1. **AIOps cluster** - A full installation of OCP that will be used to install
   Turbonomic.
2. **Apps cluster** - An instance of Single Node OpenShift that will be used to
   install the Instana and KubeTurbo agents and the sample _RobotShop_
   application. The _Quote Of The Day_ sample application has been
   pre-installed.

Virtual Machines:

1. **Guacamole VM** - A RHEL VM that will be used as the _bastion_ host into the
   lab network. Guacamole has access to all lab VM's and clusters and will be
   your primary workstation for these labs.
2. **Instana** - An Ubuntu VM that will be used to install a single node
   self-hosted Instana server.
3. **MQACE** - An Ubuntu VM that contains the pre-installed IBM ACE and MQ
   middleware.

## Lab Environment Diagram

:::note

- IBM MQ, IBM ACE and Quote of the Day have been pre-installed.
- You will install and configure all remaining components during these labs.

## Accessing your environment

:::tip

We recommend using Google Chrome to access the bastion host.

If prompted by your browser to allow copy/paste when connection to the Bastion
host we recommend answering yes.

:::

You should have received an email with a link to IBM Tech Zone. Click the link
and sign in with your IBM ID.

All access to the environment is behind the Bastion host running RHEL named
**Guacamole**.

## Import bookmarks on Guacamole

To make it easier to navigate to different applications a _bookmarks.html_ file
has been copied to each of the bastion hosts. Before you start the Instana lab
we recommend importing the bookmarks file by following the instruction below:

1. Open Firefox by selecting **Activites** from the top left of the _Guacamole_
   host and then selecting **Firefox** from the application menu bar.

   ![import bookmarks html file](images/firefox-bookmarks-5.png)

1. Expand the folder **Bookmarks Menu** and drag all of the bookmarks to the
   **Bookmarks Toolbar** for easy access.

   ![drag bookmarks to toolbar](images/firefox-bookmarks-6.png)

1. You can now select the **Bookmarks Toolbar** and delete the placeholder
   bookmark called **OCP Dashboard**.

## Linux and Mac Users

### Connect to a Server with a Private Key

1. Search for the `Terminal` app and open

2. Update your _id_rsa_ file permissions to avoid SSH permission errors

```sh
chmod 600 <path-to-key-file>/id_rsa
```

3. Access your control node using your provided SSH key:

```sh
ssh -i <path-to-your-key> <user>@<control node IP address>
```

## Windows Users

- For Windows 10 or higher, it's recommended to use
  [Windows PowerShell](#1-windows-powershell)
- For Windows users who are on lower than Windows 10, you can use
  [PuTTY](#2-putty)

### 1. Windows PowerShell

1. To open PowerShell, press `Windows+X`, and then click `Windows PowerShell`.

![Windows Start Menu](images/windowspowershell-1.png)

2. Access your control node using your provided SSH key:

```
ssh -i <path-to-your-key> <user>@<control node IP address>
```

Example:

![PowerShell SSH](images/windowspowershell-2.png)

### 2. PuTTY

Use SSH Keys with PuTTY on Windows

Requirements:

- Install PuTTY and PuTTYgen from the
  [PuTTY Download Page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
- Remote server accessible over OpenSSH

#### Use Existing Public And Private Keys

1. If you have an existing OpenSSH public and private key, copy the `id_rsa` key
   to your Windows desktop.

2. Launch `PuTTYgen` from the Windows Programs list

3. Click `Conversions` from the PuTTY Key Generator menu and select `Import key`

![PuTTY Key Gen](images/puttygen-1.png)

4. Navigate to the OpenSSH private key and click `Open`.

5. Under `Actions` -> `Save the generated key`, select `Save private key`. You
   can enter **optional** passphrase to protect the private key.

![PuTTY Key Gen](images/puttygen-2.png)

6. Save the private key to the desktop as `id_rsa.ppk`.

If the public key is already appended to the `authorized_keys` file on the
remote SSH server, then proceed to
[Connect to Server with Private Key](#connect-to-server-with-private-key).

#### Connect to Server with Private Key

1. Close the PuTTYgen tool and open `PuTTY`

2. Enter the remote server `Host Name (or IP address)` under `Session`.

![PuTTY connect to server](images/putty-1.png)

3. Navigate to `Connection -> SSH -> Auth`. Click `Browse...` under
   `Authentication parameters` -> `Private key file for authentication`

![PuTTY private key setting](images/putty-2.png)

4. Locate the `id_rsa.ppk` private key and click `Open`.

5. Finally, click `Open` again to log into the remote server with key pair
   authentication. -->
