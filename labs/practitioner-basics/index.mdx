# Getting Started

To achieve a successful deployment of AIOps (or any) software, it is important
to start with proper planning.

Planning deployments, taking into account how modern Cloud architecture stacks
work, will help you deploy stable and performant solutions, avoiding many
potential downstream issues later.

This section of the SWAT enablement is all about understanding the basics of
good planning and cluster design to set a solid foundation for your deployments.

The guides in this section aim to explain key concepts in as easy to follow
terms as possible. They are not meant to be technical deep dives into the
associated OpenShift, Kuberenetes or related topics.
