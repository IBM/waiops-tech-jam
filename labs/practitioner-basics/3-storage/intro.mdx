# Introduction

This section aims to provide guidance for what to consider, with recommendations
where possible, when planning storage for your containerised applications.

Storage is a critical element of any production environment and warrants careful
planning. The information here is meant to help non-storage SMEs understand some
of the important design points to consider when working with storage SMEs to
plan storage for a deployment.

The sub-sections are broken out based on the type of storage in use as the
nuances may vary.

:::caution Always seek expert guidance if unsure

The information in these sections should be treated as general guidance only and
a starting point to help you plan storage for your environments.

It is not intended to cover every configuration permutation and use case.

It is highly recommended to engage storage support expertise from your storage
vendor of choice for detailed planning requirements.
